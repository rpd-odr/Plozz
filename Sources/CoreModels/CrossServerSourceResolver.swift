///
/// This is the discovery half of the cross-server story (the merge half lives in
/// ``MediaItemMerger``). A title surfaced from a single server — e.g. a Home row
/// only one server populated — has no picker until we go looking for its twins on
/// the household's other servers. Because neither Plex nor Jellyfin exposes a
/// reliable "find by external id" query, discovery has to go through each server's
/// free-text search; the resulting hits are then matched back to the primary
/// **by provider IDs** (``MediaItemIdentity``) so a title stored under a *different
/// name* on another server (localised title, edition/year annotation, "The …"
/// reorder) still collapses into one card as long as it shares a strong external
/// id (IMDb/TMDb/TVDb).
///
/// The recall fix that makes "differing titles" work is ``searchQueries(for:)``:
/// in addition to the raw display title we also search with the item's
/// **original-language title** and the normalized forms of both, so a copy that
/// the other server stores under a *different* name (most importantly a foreign
/// film whose display title is localised on one server and original on the other)
/// is actually *returned* by that server's search and can reach the provider-ID
/// merge. Precision is unchanged — the merge only folds in hits that genuinely
/// share the primary's identity, so widening the query never attaches an
/// unrelated title to the picker.
