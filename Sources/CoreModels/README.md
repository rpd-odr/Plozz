# CoreModels

The Foundation-only, **zero-dependency** core of Plozz. Defines the domain
language every other module speaks.

## Responsibility

- Domain value types: `MediaItem`, `MediaLibrary`, `MediaServer`,
  `UserSession`, `Account`, `Profile`, `MusicTrack`, `Person`, etc.
- The dual-provider abstraction: `MediaProvider` protocol, `ProviderKind`,
  `ProviderRegistry` / `ProviderResolving`, `ResolvedAccount`.
- Cross-cutting UI state: `LoadState`, `AppError`.
- Shared decode/encode helpers: `JSONDecoder.plozz`, `JSONEncoder.plozz`.
- Subtitle behaviour + appearance model: `SubtitleBehavior`, `SubtitleStyle`,
  plus the neutral `SubtitleColor` / `SubtitleEdgeStyle` / `SubtitleMode` primitives.
- Profiles persistence contract: `ProfilePersisting`, `ProfileStore`,
  `ProfilesModel`, plus the Plex Home-user mapping (`PlexHomeUser`).

## Invariants

- **No SwiftUI / AVKit / UIKit imports.** This module compiles on Linux so
  pure-logic tests can run there. UI lives in `CoreUI` and feature modules.
- **Never hold secrets.** Tokens are owned by `FeatureAuth` (Keychain). Types
  here (e.g. `Account`, `Profile`) carry only non-secret metadata.
- **Provider-agnostic.** No type here may assume Jellyfin- or Plex-specific
  behavior; the only provider seam is `MediaProvider`.
- **Collections are server-defined groups, not alternate title sources.**
  Collection identity stays scoped to the owning account and item ID, even when
  two groups share a catalogue collection ID or physical server. Library
  collection discovery uses `collections(in:page:)`, advertised through
  `.libraryCollections`; `collectionMembers(of:page:)`
  is separate and preserves server membership/order rather than the grid's sort.

## Public surface, at a glance

| Concept | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Provider abstraction | `MediaProvider`, `ProviderKind`, `ProviderRegistry` |
| Domain models | `MediaItem`, `MediaLibrary`, `MediaServer`, `UserSession` |
| Multi-account | `Account`, `ResolvedAccount`, `AggregatedLibrary` |
| Profiles | `Profile`, `ProfileStore`, `ProfilesModel`, `PlexHomeUser` |
| UI state | `LoadState`, `AppError` |
| Subtitles | `SubtitleBehavior`, `SubtitleStyle` (rendered by `FeaturePlayback`) |

## Artwork and profile presentation

`MediaItem.artworkReferences` supplies library artwork: server URLs and local
sidecars. Known external URLs stay on the item with their provenance, but are
offered separately by `metadataArtworkURLs`. `ArtworkRouter` considers these
cached candidates only at their enabled provider's current rank. Unattributed
legacy enrichment is not a library fallback. Local selections must not relabel
an external URL's provenance, and neither artwork preference nor provider order
changes playback identity or server authentication.

`seriesArtworkReferences` excludes episode stills and tries genuine series
sidecars before remote series fallbacks, including on landscape surfaces.
Online-first presentation remains the shared renderer's responsibility.

Multi-role consumers pair their library-reference ladder with
`ArtworkRouter.artworkURL(for:placements:)` (or the ordered `MediaArtworkSource`
initializer). Only an explicit `.episodeThumbnail` placement queries episode
stills; series-only surfaces retain `seriesArtworkReferences` and use
`[.detailBackdrop, .seriesPoster]` for external lookup. A missing backdrop can
therefore fall through to a source-qualified poster without bypassing provider
order or enablement.

Recognized physical folders carry an optional `ArtworkLookupSubject` from the
catalog. It supplies artwork query identity only: the folder's ID, kind, title,
provider route, and artwork-account ownership remain unchanged. Unqualified
folders never use title-based artwork lookup. Collage candidates retain their
items alongside library references, and collage caches include current
presentation/provider policy before reusing a composed image.

New profiles and existing profiles adopting card labels inherit App default:
ordinary browsing/Home labels are on, with Showcase and series-artwork exceptions.
The legacy default-off Home flag does not become a new override; a legacy opt-in
still does. Unversioned Home-only off configurations matching the old automatic
migration reset to App default, including its original boolean format. That
ambiguous shape cannot distinguish an old default from an old manual Home-only
choice. Explicit show/hide presets and other per-view customizations, including
Mixed choices, are preserved.
`homeDefaultVersion` travels in the label payload, so subsequent Home-only opt-outs
survive reload, profile switching, and transfer.

Synced artwork/label-setting deletions consume their one-time legacy import
even for profiles not yet loaded on this device. The separate `.migrated` store
markers remain device-local and never enter profile transfer snapshots.

## Watch-state replay identity

New shell watch intents carry `WatchMutationServerScope`: the originating Plozz
profile and stable account/server/user identities, including the existing Plex
Home binding. It contains no credentials or process-local token revisions.
Runtime validation must also confirm that the selected Plex viewer's credential
is actually installed before resolving its provider.

The reconciler uses the existing delivery-authorization checks before dispatch.
An unavailable server viewer defers the intact mutation without consuming its
retry budget; it can resume when that viewer returns, including after relaunch.
Server-user scope separates coalescing/clocks, live-session guards and UI replay.
It does not replace the separate, deliberately non-restorable authorization
requirement used for consent-gated library-channel completion.

Scoped mutations use a version-2 ID envelope so older readers reject them rather
than ignore an unfamiliar identity field. Removing or altering that requirement
also fails decoding. Legacy unscoped mutations remain readable under their
existing behavior. They are not retroactively stamped with the current
server-user scope: their historical viewer cannot be reconstructed.

## Where to look first

- `MediaProvider.swift` — the protocol that defines every backend.
- `ProviderRegistry.swift` — how features resolve a provider from a session.
- `AppError.swift` — the single error currency used everywhere.
