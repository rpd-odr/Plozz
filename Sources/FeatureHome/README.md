# FeatureHome

Home rows, item detail, series/season experience, and the online-trailer
fallback when the user's server has no attached trailer.

## Responsibility

- **Home** — `HomeView` + `HomeViewModel` render the focused tvOS rows:
  Continue Watching, Latest, Recently Added (per library). `HomeLayout`
  centralises sizing/spacing so all rows feel uniform.
  On mobile, a root-owned `LazyViewState` retains the shared Home/Watchlist
  model by profile, credentials and active accounts. Rebuilding the tab shell
  for settings/theme changes must not construct and rehydrate throwaway models.
  Both platforms recheck hero Watchlist membership immediately, but memoize
  supporting-source identity tokens by the full current row values. No
  supporting index is built without exclusions; source-scope changes clear it.
- **Multi-account aggregation** — `HomeAggregator` fans out across the
  active account set (`[ResolvedAccount]`) so Home is a merged view
  across multiple servers / profiles. Uses the `MediaProvider`
  abstraction; never imports a specific provider module.
  All Libraries keeps reachable sources when capability preparation, query facets,
  inventory discovery, or duplicate-card hydration encounters an unavailable source.
  Inventory membership stays fixed per attempt. Before publishing a first page,
  a source lost during inventory or card hydration causes one bounded rebuild
  without that source; concurrent callers share recovery. Published pages keep
  their offsets and retry feedback rather than silently shifting existing cards.
  Refresh rediscovers sources. All-source failures
  remain retryable errors, and cancellation never becomes partial success.
  Navigation retains offline library destinations: the native sidebar includes
  Offline in its single tab title (native tabs discard separate sibling labels),
  while the pinned rail also adds a contrasting wifi-slash badge
  that stays legible when the row is focused. Compact top navigation has no
  individual library destinations.
  Failed library pages identify the affected server with its provider logo and
  saved name in a non-focusable identity chip on both platforms, alongside Retry.
  It reuses library-discovery failures and actual share-root scan results, never
  a new polling loop or cached-catalog reads as proof that a share is online.
- **Mobile Home posters** — portrait rails fit two full posters below 375pt,
  three on larger phones, and a 28% preview at standard density. Wider windows add columns;
  per-profile display-size choices scale the result. Loaded cards and placeholders
  share `PlozziOSHomeRailLayout`, and their artwork starts on the heading keyline
  after subtracting each card style's internal inset. Smaller mobile artwork uses
  proportionate corners and a 20pt minimum watched badge, without shrinking folder
  navigation badges. Continue Watching geometry and library grid columns are unchanged.
- **Showcase artwork lookahead** — A separate observer warms the policy-selected
  preview and logo for up to five nearby titles plus the leading title of either
  adjacent row. It shares the bounded background queue and artwork caches with
  Continue Watching, without observing focus in the view that builds the rows.
  Changing focus, rows, source references, or provider settings replaces only
  obsolete preparation; leaving Home cancels it. The native navigation and
  row/hero motion never await artwork or metadata.
- **Card labels** — Appearance > Cards owns profile-scoped App default,
  Show labels everywhere, and Hide labels everywhere presets, with
  On / Off values edited directly in a flat list of experiences. Editing enters
  Custom mode; selecting any preset replaces all per-view choices.
  App default shows labels during ordinary browsing and on detail-page episodes;
  it hides them in Showcase and on Continue Watching cards that carry a title on
  their artwork. Manual presets apply to all media captions, including those cards.
  Existing explicit global and per-view choices survive migration.
  Showcase is presentation context within Home or library Recommended, not a new
  override scope; destination scopes clear that context and hosting boundaries forward it.
  Home, Recommended, Browse, Collections, Playlists, Search, Watchlist, related titles,
  episodes, extras, and filmography resolve the same policy on iOS and tvOS.
  Explicit episode overrides, including previously persisted ones, are honored.
  On TV, the episode title moves down on focus and back up on exit in every
  focus style, including System; the synopsis keeps its delayed reveal.
  Loading captions use the same motion without changing row geometry, and
  Reduce Motion keeps the caption stationary.
  Collection and playlist contents follow Browse across every library. Library
  navigation, cast names, essential list text, accessibility labels, and on-artwork
  playback information stay intact. Existing Home choices migrate once from
  `HeroSettings`; the card settings transfer with the profile. Native grids and
  loading placeholders remove the same caption space as loaded cards. Touch captions
  have a 4pt gap without TV focus travel; TV captions retain their focus clearance.
  Mobile poster titles use native Dynamic Type footnote (13pt normally), with
  caption1 subtitles (12pt). Compact density does not shrink them below those styles.
  Framed, borderless, and loading cards share these tokens; landscape and TV type stay unchanged.
  Mobile poster and series-artwork rails reserve the subtitle line when labels are
  shown, even when metadata is absent, matching
  loading placeholders and keeping adjacent captions and row heights aligned.
- Mobile library provider icons align with the thumbnail's leading edge; the
  library name and server name share the adjacent text column.
- **Shared mobile row rhythm** — Home, library recommendations, search groups,
  related titles, extras (including loading/failure), and cast use
  `PlozziOSMediaSection`: native Dynamic Type `title3` semibold headings, a 12pt
  heading-to-artwork layout gap, and 32pt between sections. Mobile media surfaces
  sit 12pt apart; framed cards retain their interior artwork insets. Scroll shadow
  clearance does not add invisible vertical padding, and framed artwork shares
  the same vertical keylines as borderless posters. Normal-size headings truncate
  at the tail; accessibility sizes wrap. Card sizing, caption preferences, native
  page titles and tvOS typography remain separate from this shared section style.
- **Item detail** — `ItemDetailView` + `ItemDetailViewModel` and
  `DetailHeroView` / `DetailExtrasView` render the cinematic full-bleed
  backdrop, logo, overview, ratings, cast, and Play/Resume button. Works
  for movies, episodes, and people.
  An episode's show breadcrumb is a single native button showing only the show
  title and chevron, without a background or border in either focus state.
  Play takes initial focus when available; Up then reaches
  the show, preserving its source account and season. Episodes without Play
  keep the breadcrumb immediately eligible for focus.
  Page ownership is identity-based, not an appearance-callback counter: repeated
  appearances and late departures cannot hide a different detail or give it the
  previous movie's trailer. A confirmed cancelled cinematic Back restores the page that
  remains on the real navigation stack, removes its cover/input guard, and keeps
  its controls focusable. Older transition completions cannot finish a newer pop.
  The bounded debug handoff journal records page membership, return outcomes,
  and hashed trailer ownership so an intermittent failure can be inspected
  without restarting the affected app.
- **Series** — `SeriesDetailView` + `SeriesResume` provide one stable
  series backdrop with focus-driven season tabs and an episode rail; the
  hero text updates as focus moves without distracting backdrop swaps.
  The compact logo above Seasons fits wholly inside its 200pt slot, including
  tall wordmarks; it does not use the full hero's flexible height allowance.
  This changes only artwork sizing, not season/episode focus geometry.
  While the browser reveals, only the outer page's native scrolling is held:
  horizontal episode focus stays live without provoking a second vertical
  scroll that lifts the logo. The page restores normal scrolling when the
  reveal finishes or is cancelled. Season pills, resting episode artwork,
  loading cards, and About share the same leading keyline; card spacing stays
  on the trailing side rather than indenting the artwork.
  The shared hero/browser motion uses a finite 0.9-second curve with an earlier
  slowdown and gentle landing, including logo and backdrop parallax.
  A spring's logical completion leaves
  several points of upward travel after the apparent landing, even when the
  outer page never scrolls.
  When pinned navigation hides on detail pages, horizontal rows draw through
  the empty side gutter to the screen edge, including focused episode artwork.
  The sidebar's mask changes without replacing the scroll view, preserving
  browse position and restoring the normal feather when navigation returns.
- **Library browsing** — `LibraryBrowseView` + `LibraryBrowseViewModel`
  show Recommended by default for server-backed video libraries, with
  library-scoped Continue Watching and Recently Added plus native Plex hubs
  or Jellyfin/Emby movie recommendation categories. TV uses Showcase, showing
  its mode tabs only while the first row is active; mobile uses touch-sized rows.
  iPhone and iPad keep Recommended, Browse, Collections, and Playlists in a
  horizontally scrolling tab strip, limited to the provider's capabilities.
  Library modes and series seasons both use CoreUI's `PlozzContentTabs`, with
  the same selected glass pill, inactive text, touch sizing, and reveal behavior.
  Tabs retain their identity through loading, empty, and failure states and
  reveal the selected mode without compressing every label into a segmented
  control. At accessibility sizes, an individual tab still fits the viewport.
  Mobile controls scroll with the page; Filter and the current Sort occupy a
  separate line instead of competing with the tabs. Row headings, artwork, grids,
  and scan banners share the mobile page keyline (22pt compact, 36pt regular).
  Mode changes reset to the padded page's true top, keeping both the tabs and
  native navigation-bar scroll-edge appearance consistent across all four modes.
  Recommendation rails remain horizontally lazy and share touch card appearance
  and the same heading, visible spacing, and artwork keylines as mobile Home.
  Library Continue Watching uses Home's profile-selected series artwork and
  resume progress treatment, including profile spoiler protection on mobile.
  Merged libraries validate Continue Watching against every account-qualified
  source, merge duplicate titles with their source references, and order by
  watch recency before limiting the row. Watch changes
  refresh recommendations on return (or while visible), retaining the current
  rows during the request and rejecting snapshots predating another watch change.
  On tvOS, changing tabs keeps the focused mode control
  mounted while replacing content below it. A stable layout container owns the
  top inset across Recommended, Browse, Collections, and Playlists (a transparent
  `Group` would attach the inset to each replaceable content branch).
  Library pages discard the native container's top-bar inset and reserve only
  screen-safe spacing plus clearance for the native sidebar's visible page button.
  The outer focus host and Recommended content both break out at the trailing
  edge so artwork reaches the screen edge; headers and grids retain their safe
  margins, including the custom pinned rail's foreground inset. Home is unchanged.
  Sort sits on that same top navigation line alongside Filter and file browsing.
  Filter and Sort form a compact pair. Alphabet navigation stays on the
  scrolling rail; there is no separate Jump to letter button.
  Without mode tabs, the library/share display name occupies the left of the
  same header, with controls on the right; it does not add a focus target.
  A persistent tvOS focus owner encloses the header and grid, preserving
  the selected tab's focus identity as content changes. The content slot stays full-height
  during loading, keeping the header in place and query progress vertically
  centered below it. Scan progress remains in the grid. Its hosting view is
  constrained to the collection's supplementary header, which alone owns the
  placed size. Do not pre-size that view and then autoresize it when the header
  grows: a live scan update would apply the size delta twice, overlapping posters
  until another focus/layout pass. Banner height and artwork alignment must be
  correct while unfocused, through focus changes, and when progress reappears.
  Showcase preserves the Home-sized details footprint under that header,
  keeping the same metadata-to-heading clearance as Home. A cold logo is adopted
  when it finishes for the still-current title, without requiring a focus round trip.
  Its title slot stays visually empty while the logo resolves; text appears only
  after no usable logo is found, never as a temporary title before the wordmark.
  Showcase gates lower rows only until the first row actually receives native
  focus, so an already-ready Discover row cannot win cold-start entry while
  Continue Watching is still realizing. Once entered, normal navigation and
  later data updates do not reclaim focus from another row.
  Navigation eligibility follows the current row order when a refresh removes
  or inserts a row, without requiring focus to move. Hub identities are scoped
  by their source and content, not by their position among other rows.
  The scrolling header forwards public styling and enabled state to its hosted
  SwiftUI content, not another hosting tree's private accessibility state.
  Returning to the first row re-enables the same controls after Showcase hides them.
  Filter joins the same header line. Quick filters intersect genre and year;
  its label names the selected options while they fit, falling back to their
  count only when the available header space is too narrow. Tabs and Sort retain
  their room, and accessibility always announces the full selection.
  The compact count uses localized plural forms; format names such as Dolby
  Vision stay verbatim in both the menu and selection summary.
  App-authored recommendation headings retain localization resources through
  caching and source qualification, so language changes update existing rows
  without changing their identities. Provider-authored headings stay verbatim.
  On tvOS, library tabs, Filter, and Sort move with the grid instead of staying
  over the posters. Their native controls remain mounted during query changes
  so returning to the top and changing filters or modes preserves focus.
  The native grid's viewport spans the full screen vertically, with content
  insets preserving the header and bottom spacing. Disabling clipping alone
  does not prevent UIKit from hiding artwork at an inset viewport boundary;
  partly visible posters must keep rendering until they leave the screen.
  Offscreen rows still recycle normally.
  Sort/filter choices are remembered per library, account, mode, and profile.
  Genre/year options use each server's scoped facet endpoint; Jellyfin/Emby use
  `/Items/Filters`, whose response contains genre names and years. Empty successful
  responses are cached, cancellation is not a load error, and actual failures
  retain a retry action separate from the selected quick filter.
  Facet requests belong to the library model and are shared across menu mounts,
  so canceling a disappearing menu does not discard a replacement menu's options.
  Catalog changes reload facets and reject pre-refresh responses; watch-only
  changes retain the cached genre/year options.
  Native provider operations remain paged. Explicit non-native options prepare
  a cancellable utility-priority inventory of compact IDs/query facts, not a
  full-card Home cache. Ordinary Home, Browse, and facet menus never inventory.
  Inventory pages are bounded to 120, visible-card materialization to three
  concurrent reads, and estimated retained facts to 24 MiB; inconsistent or
  incomplete inventories fail explicitly instead of displaying partial totals.
  Cancelled inventory tasks are retired before reuse; a live coalesced caller
  retries when another caller cancels their shared task. Random filtering uses
  deterministic server traversal before locally ordering the collected records.
  Richer cached facts cover simpler subsequent sorts. Changing history sorts or
  watch state reuses file facts for up to two minutes without retaining stale
  history or repeating version hydration; catalog changes discard those facts.
  Watch/catalog changes invalidate query membership/history without scanning covered library views.
  A failed background refresh retains the grid and retries the refresh itself
  through Try Again, rather than only retrying failed paging requests.
  Series format/history queries roll up logical episodes, not alternate files.
  Merged query cards retain their verified inventory membership when loading
  full details. Duplicates includes distinct copies within one account and
  separate files for the same episode, but excludes out-of-scope index hints.
  Filtered alphabet offsets follow actual sorted positions, including non-Latin
  titles, rather than assuming the catch-all bucket comes first.
  Missing sort values stay last; original provider ratings remain distinct from
  externally enriched display ratings. Shares read existing catalog metadata
  without initiating per-item network enrichment or media probing.
  Share facets use the same representative movie/series metadata and local
  precedence as browse cards; filtered titles retain their native sort inputs,
  including exact local premiere dates. Shares do not offer critic/content-rating
  sorts without corresponding catalog metadata.
  Your Rating is offered only where the provider exposes a personal rating;
  Silo Rotten Tomatoes sorts require its authenticated ratings capability.
  Browse retains its paged grid,
  and video libraries can also switch to Collections and Playlists when their
  provider advertises those capabilities. File shares and collection/playlist
  members continue to open in Browse. Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby discover existing video
  playlists by actual member/library intersection; a mixed playlist appears
  in each matching library but opens with its full authored order. Music
  playlists remain in `MusicProvider`. Unsupported sources (including Silo)
  do not advertise a video-playlist mode. Snapshots are bound to the provider
  account and refreshed on the first page, not during poster scrolling.
- **Trailers** — `OnlineTrailerSource` and `TrailerResolutionCache`
  handle the TMDb → YouTube fallback when the server has no attached
  trailer, by routing through `ProviderTrailers.YouTubeTrailerProvider`
  to surface a real `PlaybackRequest`.
  Background hero trailers use one shared player. Detail departure stops its
  trailer unless the router is returning directly to a rendered, unreceded Home
  hero showing the same title with trailers enabled. Library, Watchlist, pushed
  grids, and covered detail pages cannot retain background audio. A cancelled
  or no-longer-frontmost detail resolver cannot start a trailer after departure.

## Home loading

On iPhone and iPad, the loading and loaded Home layouts share the hero visibility
gate. Disabling the hero or deselecting all its sources removes both the carousel
and its placeholder, including the reserved height. Only an active hero extends
under the top safe area; a rows-only Home keeps its first row below navigation.

Library cards preserve server-supplied cover artwork. Missing covers use a stable,
locally composed poster collage from that exact library, with a provider-colored
fallback for empty or unavailable sources. All cards carry the shared provider
mark (including explicit SMB/WebDAV/NFS transport badges), while server/account
captions continue to distinguish same-provider servers.

`LibraryArtworkSource` requests at most 18 library items and selects six unique
poster candidates. `LibraryCollageCache` coalesces requests, admits at most two
libraries and three poster transfers at once, and composes a single 720x405 texture
on a serial utility queue. Visible covers use the foreground artwork lane rather
than waiting behind speculative prefetch. The raw Browse Files root uses the same
account's indexed latest media, never a recursive filesystem walk. Library names
are not drawn over artwork. Provider badges sit beside the library name in the caption below the
artwork on TV and mobile, never on the cover or collage; no logo scrim is applied.
They use `ProviderBrandMark`'s standard provider-tinted circular background and
optically balanced internal padding, including its existing Plex size adjustment.
Native captions center the badge and short title together, keep the badge fixed
while long names marquee, and move both together on focus without adding a focus target.
Native library, poster, and landscape captions share the same density-aware
artwork-to-caption gap, including loading placeholders. Native focus overflow
stays outside the artwork layout slot. Poster caption travel reserves at least
24 points for TVUIKit's enlargement, including compact densities, without
reflowing the row or changing animation timing. Native library grids use the
same resting gap and focus travel; playback-panel and circular-tile captions
retain their own geometry.
Transparent server covers retain their alpha but use the same rounded native
poster treatment as opaque covers, rather than alpha-shaped cutout focus.
This changes the native image-view treatment, not the cached artwork bitmap.
Transport marks stack the complete drive symbol above their label with balanced
vertical padding.
The decoded cache is capped at 16 MiB; the bounded disk derivative cache at 8 MiB.
Collage keys use a stable profile identity, not the app container's absolute path,
so installing another build does not invalidate them. Returning cards seed their
first frame synchronously from decoded memory; disk reads, decoding and composition
remain asynchronous and off the main thread.
Keys include the Home profile scope, account, effective server user, library and
credential revision. No authenticated artwork URLs are persisted by this cache.
Focus changes do not reload or compose artwork. Native TV posters receive the
same cached bitmap as mobile/custom cards; clipping and focus geometry stay unchanged.

Home gives inventory, each global feed, and per-library rows independent queues
of at most five operations each. Slow resume feeds cannot occupy the slots
needed to start other row types. Each global row arrives
once its own sources are complete, preserving cross-server deduplication and
ordering. A slow Continue Watching feed therefore retains its own skeleton
without holding up Watchlist, Recently Added, or per-library rows.
Progressive publication keeps failures, reconciled content, and loading state
together after pending watch-state reads finish. A partial server failure must
not replace Continue Watching's focusable loading slot with an error while
healthy cards are still reconciling. Usable cards retain focus; a settled empty
failed row still presents its error.
If library visibility changes while a load is in flight, the model replaces the
obsolete load even when Home's view-owned task is absent. Discarding stale
results must never strand a row on loading placeholders.

Adding an owned library title to Watchlist retains its verified source and full
presentation in memory, even when Search is the only place that loaded it.
Opening that entry does not depend on a native-watchlist refresh or a warm
identity index to recover Play, episodes, or the selected server artwork.
Both shells share this handoff. Retained items follow alias redirects, are
pruned with membership, and are discarded when the profile, active accounts,
credentials, or Plex Home identity changes. They are not persisted or synced as
ownership evidence; discovery items and synced identity hints remain unowned
until a local provider verifies a copy.

Enabled library rows start as soon as their inventory is known. Recently Added
and recommendation requests complete independently, in stable library/row slots.
Both shells use the same loading/error state; failed rows can be retried without
removing successful rows. Cancellation stops queued requests. Parent-series
identity lookups are coalesced per account and load, and incomplete Home content
does not overwrite the durable snapshot.

Showcase keeps its first-row anchor while that row loads; a lower row finishing
does not choose focus or scroll the page. Its leading loading card has a visible
progress indicator and can hold focus without making the other skeletons
interactive. The waiting card uses the loaded cards' shared focus treatment:
native TVUIKit for System, lighting/lift for Highlight, and glass for Outline.
Borderless effects belong to the artwork, not its wider layout/caption slot;
framed cards use the same concentric card surface as loaded content.
After the viewer navigates, it keeps the focused card when an earlier row finishes.
Classic Home preserves loaded cards' focus-binding hierarchy when an empty
earlier row disappears, so the new first row does not recreate its focused card.
Carousel rows share a native focus
section so Down can cross a loading row to reach usable content. Placeholder and
resolved heroes use the same row-recede geometry. The `PLZBOOT` row-ready events distinguish first usable
data from completion of the entire Home load.

## Showcase

`FocusHeroHomeView` keeps focus-driven movement and hero updates outside the
row-building view. Posters use the profile's full normal poster dimensions.
Preview headings have a 16pt inter-row spacer above them and more room below
before their cards. Only the active heading lifts, preserving its focus
clearance. That movement is a title-only drawing offset, not a rail
relayout. Native card/shadow drawing bounds remain intact.
Vertical movement uses a real `ScrollView` with additive native springs,
not a main-thread display link advancing the content offset. Each press adds
only its destination adjustment; existing springs keep running with their
original clocks and velocity. Stopping and recreating a spring on every press
makes held-remote navigation pulse between rows.
Springs and height keyframes start at the actual Core Animation commit, not an
earlier wall-clock timestamp. Otherwise a busy focus/layout update can skip
most of the first visible movement. Retargeting reads the native resolved clocks;
hosted coverage checks 90ms retargets and a deliberately delayed 150ms commit.
The mask and hero-column height follow the
viewport's presentation trajectory through the measured row anchors, not a
separate spring started by the destination change. Rapid Up can target Continue
Watching while the viewport still traverses taller rows; the height remains
unchanged until that viewport reaches the shorter-row interval. Smooth height
interpolation has zero slope at each anchor, avoiding a velocity jump on entering
or leaving the interval. Native keyframes are calculated once per retarget and
run on the compositor, without per-frame SwiftUI updates. Late row measurements
refresh that path from its painted position even if the destination is unchanged.
The lifted heading retains the same nonbouncing spring timing.
Focus still chooses the row and its
measured bottom edge determines the exact destination, preserving the hero,
heading positions and next-row peek. Only the outer viewport's automatic
scrolling is disabled to avoid a second competing focus-reveal animation;
horizontal rows stay native and retain their focus and scroll state. The rows
remain SwiftUI content in stable native hosts, including navigation and accessibility.
Each row retains its intrinsic vertical size rather than filling a host's height
proposal, including the custom-focus horizontal scroll views.
Hosts forward the public profile, styling and media-action environment values;
copying the entire SwiftUI environment also copies internal accessibility state
from the parent hosting tree and hides the hosted content from accessibility.
The media-item router retains a comparable identity within its navigation scope.
Refreshing its callback uses the latest route without invalidating every realized
card's context menu; enabling or disabling navigation still updates the menus.
Native-host coverage changes the route callback during upward navigation and
asserts that already-realized cards do not rebuild their action lists.
Vertical row owners remain in a `VStack`: the native model offset reaches its
destination before the presentation viewport does. A `LazyVStack` would recycle
rows that are still visibly passing through the viewport, especially during
repeated presses and reversals. Individual horizontal rails keep their normal
card windowing; preserving vertical owners does not realize every library item.
Repeated updates to an unchanged destination never cancel an in-flight scroll,
and Reduce Motion moves directly to the same anchor.
The first row rests at native scroll offset zero. Its measured height is
subtracted equally from the leading spacer and every scroll destination, keeping
the pinned geometry unchanged while letting the system sidebar button recognize
the top of Home. Native chrome still auto-hides farther down and returns at the
first row. The UI regression checks actual painted chrome, not just its
accessibility presence, including sidebar and detail returns.
The schedule badge sits 16pt above the logo slot; Showcase
constrains even tall logos to that slot rather than letting artwork grow into
the badge. The outgoing row tucks upward by up to 110pt behind the 24pt mask fade so no
bottom strip remains above the next row. This offset has its own native spring:
deriving it from the scroll view's logical geometry makes the returning row
release all 110pt immediately, ahead of the moving presentation viewport.
Earlier rows retain native Up eligibility;
making their entire mask transparent would break that navigation. Showcase's
backdrop uses wider leading and bottom gradients without lengthening its crossfade.
Crossfade is the only Showcase backdrop transition. The retired slide preference
is ignored when reading older settings without resetting the remaining choices.
Showcase's optional titles under cards follow Appearance > Cards;
they do not control title visibility elsewhere in the app.

With pinned navigation, the carousel extends its leading fade to the top edge,
blending into the unchanged bottom shading through a variant of the existing
cached scrim, not an extra compositing pass. Detail pages have no pinned rail:
all navigation styles keep the softer top-left corner there. Detail shading
fades in as the artwork cover hands off, just before the logo and metadata,
without adding a mask or changing the artwork's position. Native Home navigation
retains the original shading; Showcase already fades its artwork into the
background along the full leading edge.

Native poster layout slots use artwork size on both axes, rounding fractional
heights up so SwiftUI cannot round artwork down into its caption. TVUIKit's focus
margins settle after realization and draw outside that slot; feeding their
changing height into a lazy row shifts both the pinned row and hero during deep
horizontal scrolling. Hosted native-poster coverage checks this before and
after layout, and the Home UI regression traverses all 75 fixture cards.
Native poster overlays cache their logo/badge/progress composite at the current
display scale. Only that hosted overlay is rasterized; native artwork and focus
effects remain live, and changes to overlay content invalidate the cached image.

Libraries uses the same unclipped horizontal viewport as media rows. Native
navigation lets focused artwork and scrolling cards draw through the page gutter
to the screen edge. Pinned navigation's shared feather retains 10% artwork
opacity beneath the icons through the physical leading edge, rising smoothly to
full opacity near the first card across a 48pt feather. The faint floor explicitly
overhangs the row because Showcase's nested native hosts suppress safe-area
propagation; relying on `ignoresSafeArea` alone clips it before the icons.
Extending that floor does not move or widen the feather, add a second mask, or
change scrolling, parking, or focus identity.

Discover hydrates and displays its saved candidates with the same featured-only
configuration used by Showcase's live curation. Without eligible cached content,
its stable row slot shows loading posters until curation completes, rather than
inserting a new row during navigation. An initially empty result removes the slot;
disabling Discover does not reserve it. Lower loading rows never take focus.

Once populated, Discover keeps its entire lineup for the app session, not just
the focused or currently visible cards. Opening details, changing tabs,
backgrounding, freshness ticks, and watched-state updates do not replace or
reorder titles. Matching status and verified routing still refresh in place.
An explicit configuration or profile/account-scope change resets the selection;
retention never overrides source authorization. Fullscreen Hero keeps its
existing carousel refresh policy.

Discover records exposure only after at least half a real card is visible for
two seconds while Home is frontmost and the scene active. A single native row
sampler respects horizontal/vertical clipping and the Showcase mask without
publishing SwiftUI state or treating lazy realization as an impression. The
profile-scoped history favors unseen cached titles on the next cold launch.
Background cache writes retain unexposed alternatives, clear unverified routing
from retained-only discoveries, and fill remaining capacity with refreshed
candidates; they never publish those replacements into the current lineup.

Metadata belongs to the current Home view-model identity (profile, account set,
and credential generation), never a process-global cache. Cached details only
fill presentation gaps in the current row record: watched/resume state, source
identity, availability, and the selected series remain current. Background
enrichment publishes batches of at most four, and focus-driven loads share the
same deduplication. Each title observes only its own metadata entry, so unrelated
enrichment does not rebuild the active hero. `FocusHeroMetadataTests` covers freshness and ownership;
`ShowcaseNavigationTests` covers geometry and native presented-frame hitches.
For existing-library coverage, the guarded physical driver supports
`--run-showcase-mixed`: it verifies on-screen Continue Watching, deep mixed-speed
paging, rapid reversals, sustained deep holds, stable vertical anchors, and
slow/fast tours through multiple real rows.
Its functional result is separate from `--measure-right` and
`--measure-vertical-burst` native hitch measurements. The driver accepts an
explicitly confirmed `PLOZZ_HOME_APP_CONFIGURATION=Debug-optimized` candidate
as well as Release; it never rebuilds or replaces the app under measurement.
Use optimized physical-device measurements for performance acceptance, not
simulator timing or passing navigation assertions alone.

## Detail watch-state updates

The shared `ItemDetailViewModel` applies account-scoped watch mutations to both
the displayed item and its separate source-picker records. Playing an SMB copy
must update a Plex-backed merged detail even when cross-server synchronization
is disabled, without changing the Plex copy's state. The next Play/Resume target
uses those same updated records rather than a stale pre-play position.

Local edits remain authoritative for the open page across delayed source
enrichment, snapshot restoration, and source switches while provider writes
converge. Metadata-only enrichment must not copy unified progress into an
untargeted physical source. Regressions cover the production stop notification,
source selection, completion, unwatch, and unrelated-account ID collisions.

## Invariants

- **Provider-agnostic.** All data flows through `MediaProvider`. No
  Jellyfin- or Plex-specific code paths above the provider seam.
- **Server art first.** External art (`MetadataKit`) is used as a
  fallback via `CoreUI.FallbackAsyncImage`, never as the default — the
  server's own backdrop/logo is always tried first.
  Shared logo views pair fallback lookups with the source item/account and
  metadata query. Memoized logos and in-flight tasks also distinguish artwork
  preference, so a missing server logo never gives unrelated titles a shared
  cache entry. A reused view rejects the previous title's image immediately.
- **`LoadState` everywhere.** Loading / empty / failure rendering uses
  `CoreUI.ContentStateView` so all surfaces feel identical.
- **No tokens in logs.** Provider calls log only opaque ids — never
