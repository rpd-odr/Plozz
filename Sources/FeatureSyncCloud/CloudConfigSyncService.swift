// MARK: - CloudConfigSyncService
//
// The CloudKit "Stage 1" auto-sync layer, rebuilt on the pure `SyncLedger` (CoreModels)
// after two independent reviews condemned the V2 mirror. The ledger is the merge /
// conflict brain; this actor is the thin, CORRECT CloudKit glue around it:
//   • Local edits: capture a flat [recordName: canonicalBytes] map, `reconcileLocal`
//     into upload/delete plans, enqueue them, let CKSyncEngine send (automatic).
//   • Remote changes: decode fetched CKRecords → `applyFetched` → apply the EXACT
//     local changes to the app's stores (never re-derives/clobbers).
//   • Conflicts: CloudKit change tags detect them on send (`serverRecordChanged`);
//     the ledger resolves by mutation-boundary last-writer-wins.
//   • Deletions are durable (pendingDelete tombstones) and authoritative.
//   • Redownload is a full-resync lifecycle that can't resurrect peer deletions.
//   • Engine events are GENERATION-FENCED: a stale engine (after a rebuild) can never
//     mutate state.
//
// Automatic by design: `automaticallySync = true` + CKSyncEngine's own push
// subscription do the syncing; the manual affordances are just nudges. NO secrets.
//
// MULTIPLEXING: Apple permits exactly ONE active `CKSyncEngine` per private
// database. This actor owns that single engine and fans it out across multiple
// independent CHANNELS (a schema + its own `SyncLedger`), one per synced zone —
// currently Config V3 (the `Configuration` passed to `init`, kept as the primary
// channel for state-file/API compatibility) and, optionally, additional channels
// such as `PlozzMediaStateV1` (see `ChannelConfiguration`). Every CloudKit entry
// point (zone creation, queued changes, batch building, fetched records/deletions,
// send outcomes, zone deletions, inventory checks, full resync, delete-all/reset,
// account changes) routes each record/event to the channel whose schema matches
// its zone, so the channels' ledgers, state files, and app callbacks stay fully
// disjoint even though they share one engine, one container, and one delegate.
