# Plozz testing: data-driven selection & build-once policy

Purpose: run the *right* tests fast during the agentic inner loop, and the full
sweep only when it matters — speed without sacrificing quality. All target/suite
knowledge is **derived at runtime** from `swift package dump-package`; nothing in
the test tooling hardcodes the target list, so new targets (e.g. the WebDAV work's
`MediaTransportWebDAVTests`) are picked up automatically.

## The two speed wins

### 1. Build once, run many (`tools/run-tests.sh`)
The old runner looped `xcodebuild test` **once per test target** — 23 separate
build + simulator-install + launch cycles. Since the tests themselves execute in
well under a minute of CPU, ~all the wall-clock was 23× compile + simulator
orchestration. The runner now does **one** `xcodebuild test` against the
always-present `Plozz-Package` scheme:
- **Full sweep:** `xcodebuild test -scheme Plozz-Package` (no `-only-testing`).
- **Subset:** `-scheme Plozz-Package -only-testing:<Suite>` for each selected suite.
- **Single suite with a materialised native `<Suite>` scheme:** used directly (rare
  locally — SPM publishes per-*module* schemes like `CoreModels`, not
  `CoreModelsTests`, and module schemes are not test-configured — so single-suite
  runs normally also go through `Plozz-Package -only-testing`).

`Plozz-Package` is the only test-capable scheme, so build-once relies on the
existing self-heal: a stray generated `Plozz.xcodeproj` shadows the Swift package
and blocks `Plozz-Package`; the runner moves it aside when needed and restores it
on exit.

`-only-testing` filters which suites **run**, not what is **built** — a subset run
still compiles the full test graph once. The win is collapsing 23 build +
orchestration cycles into **one**, not compiling less.

**Flake guard:** if the single run reports specific failed suite bundles, each is
retried **once** in isolation; a suite only fails if it fails twice. A build/compile
failure or an incomplete matrix is not retried. Failed targets are read from
`xcresult`, including tests that crashed before XCTest restarted their bundle.
This covers the occasional
`ProviderPlexTests` StubHTTPClient timing race.

`PLOZZ_PARALLEL=YES` opts into `-parallel-testing-enabled YES`. It is **off by
default, and measurement says keep it that way**: a full parallel sweep on this
Mac had not reported a single bundle result after *8 minutes* (versus ~1m45 total
serially), because xcodebuild clones the tvOS simulator per worker and the boot
cost dwarfs anything it could overlap.

`PLOZZ_LOG_DIR=<dir>` keeps xcodebuild's raw log instead of discarding it. The
per-test `Test Case '-[Suite testX]' passed (N seconds)` lines only exist there,
so this is how you find out which individual tests are slow:

```
PLOZZ_LOG_DIR=/tmp/prof tools/run-tests.sh
grep -Eo "Test Case .*passed \([0-9.]+ seconds\)" /tmp/prof/main.log | sort -t'(' -k2 -rn | head -20
```

### Where a full sweep's time actually goes (measured, warm DerivedData)

| Phase | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| arch-guard + test-hygiene + `dump-package` | ~6s |
| incremental build check + first bundle install | ~15s |
| **per-bundle simulator install/launch, 38 bundles × ~1.0s** | **~38s** |
| test bodies actually executing (4663 tests) | ~27s |
| verdict grace before reaping xcodebuild | ~6s |

The single largest line is **not** the tests — it is the fixed ~1s the simulator
charges to install and launch each of the 38 `.xctest` bundles. That is the price
of the module granularity that makes *scoped* builds cheap, and it is charged per
selected suite, so the inner loop (`test-fast.sh`, 1–3 suites) pays ~1–3s of it
rather than 38s. Consolidating test targets to dodge it would make every scoped
run compile far more than it needs to — a bad trade for the loop that runs
hundreds of times a day. Don't chase it; use `test-fast.sh`.

### 2. Change-scoped selection (`tools/test-fast.sh` + `tools/test-impact.py`)
`tools/test-impact.py` builds the package's internal target dependency graph from
`swift package dump-package`, computes for each **test** target the transitive set
of source targets it reaches, and inverts that into `sourceModule → covering test
targets`. `tools/test-fast.sh` maps your `git diff` to a selection and runs only
those suites via `run-tests.sh` (build-once).

Because `CoreModels`, `CoreNetworking`, `MediaTransportCore` etc. are depended on
by many targets, a change to one of them naturally selects everything that depends
on it — **"foundational escalation" falls out of the data with no hardcoded list**.

**Guardrails (never silently skip):** `test-impact.py` forces the **full matrix**
whenever a change could invalidate the map itself or is otherwise unmappable —
`Package.swift`/`Package.resolved`, anything under `tools/` or `.github/`,
`project.yml`/`Config/**`, `*.xctestplan`, or any changed code path it can't map to
a test target. Pure docs/asset changes select nothing. Every run prints the chosen
suites and the reason each was selected.
This automatic fallback is conservative input to the agent's assessment, not a
requirement to run the full app matrix for a Python-tooling or documentation edit.
Use explicit relevant suites/checks when the actual impact is narrower.

### Main-gate execution and reuse

Ordinary main landings use **risk-based agent judgment**, favoring the smallest
justified validation rather than a blanket full matrix. Inspect the actual diff,
affected behavior, and existing source-matched evidence. Already validated
tooling/test-only changes usually need no new app tests or builds; a narrow UI
change may need its hosted regression; shared behavioral or build-graph changes
may justify wider coverage. Explain the choice briefly. Do not use a filename
category alone to force a full run, and do not skip a known relevant failure.

Use one runner, recording the assessment, selected checks, prior evidence
references, timings, and omitted suites. Cheap architecture, test-hygiene,
localization-source guard, catalog validation, snapshot consistency, clean-tree,
and fresh-main checks remain. Choose full suites or signed builds only for a
concrete coverage gap/risk or an explicit request. Focused passing results are
reported as focused results, never as a full-suite pass.

When translatable source/copy, comments, plurals, or permission text changed,
complete extraction and the reviewed delta pipeline in `translations.md` before
publication. An empty delta needs no artifact assembly/import. Distribution
uses the risk-based release selection below; signing, archive verification,
localization, and release-note approval remain required.

An interrupted landing may reuse a completed phase only when its consumed
source/configuration, toolchain/SDK, package workspace, simulator runtime, and
command recipe match. `tools/lib/l10n_freshness.py` derives consumers from the
current Swift package and XcodeGen dependency graphs. A TV-only hosted fixture
edit reruns TV hosted tests, not package tests, iOS hosted tests, or app builds.
Shared production changes invalidate every consumer. Unknown paths, configuration,
and tooling are conservatively shared inputs; ordinary documentation and the
completed localization snapshot do not invalidate compilation. Documentation
explicitly consumed as a target resource still does.
Run whole-tree architecture and test-hygiene guards on every invocation,
including when package-test evidence is reused.

Keep the authoritative passing summary and expected-bundle
evidence, not just a success marker; missing or changed evidence reruns the gate.
A failed fresh attempt invalidates an earlier success. Inputs changing between
phases prevent the combined candidate from being declared ready. Invalidating a
cached full-suite result does not itself require running that suite: reassess
whether the changed behavior needs it.

Local main publishers use `tools/main-landing.py`'s shared Git-directory lock
from the initial main preflight through the verified push, releasing it before
device delivery. The hook reenters an inherited lock and checks the source guard,
current catalog, and source snapshot without invoking extraction builds.
Source extraction is part of relevant development/localization work, not every
push. Feature pushes do not wait. This coordinates participating
linked worktrees, not old runners or other machines. A standalone hook owns the
lock only during its checks, not Git's subsequent network update. Fresh-main
verification and non-force publication remain mandatory.

Signed products additionally require matching build identity, executable and
resource-seal fingerprints, and fresh signature verification before reuse.
After the selected checks pass, recheck `main` and publish the authorized update **before**
independent physical-device installation. Unavailable-device retry budgets stay
unchanged but are not part of the main-push prerequisite. Keep the enclosing
build lease through remaining delivery and retain exact artifacts as usual.

For hosted UI speed, replace setup sleeps only with observable readiness.
`waitForHostedLayout` bounds waits for stable layer geometry and completed
animations in static library/multiview matrices. Keep loading/shimmer waits and
negative focus-observation windows intact; continuously animated fixtures are
not candidates for this helper. Viewport, Dynamic Type, OCR, and pixel assertions
must remain unchanged. Record actual timings rather than assuming a shorter
sleep improves a run.

### TestFlight: risk-based checks and a frozen candidate

TestFlight preparation is not an automatic full-matrix main gate. Select checks
from the net change since the last distributed build and the evidence already
collected during development. Record the selection, evidence, omitted suites,
and remaining stages before starting expensive work.

| Change | Default additional validation |
| --- | --- |
| Narrow UI change | Affected hosted tests on the affected platform |
| Shared behavior | Relevant package suites and affected platform integration tests |
| Broad or high-risk change, inadequate evidence | Expand to the necessary full suites |
| Release tooling only | Offline orchestration tests, then the real archive/export checks |
| Notes or ordinary documentation only | Catalog/rendering and relevant integrity checks; no app test sweep |

Run cheap release preflight first: verify credentials without printing them,
symbol-upload prerequisites, release identity, and catalog validity. After
release-tooling changes, run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p
test_fastlane_pipeline.py` before app tests or archives. The offline suite must
exercise real helper registration, not only mocked lane implementations.

Integrate the intended main revision once, complete requested fixes and
localization, commit the notes, and freeze the candidate before approval and
expensive validation. Record its exact commit and approved platform renderings.
Do not pull subsequent main changes into a frozen release automatically. If new
content is explicitly added, reassess only affected coverage and renew content
approval rather than restarting every stage.

Reuse passing evidence when its consumed source/configuration and execution
inputs match. A commit hash or conservative cache miss alone does not justify
rerunning every suite: inspect the delta and record a narrower coverage decision.
Do not label stale results as current or a focused run as a full-suite pass.
Tooling, test, or documentation-only changes do not invalidate app behavior
evidence when their lack of effect on its inputs is demonstrated.

Recover at the failed stage. Diagnose an assertion before rerunning tests;
rerun the affected scope after a fix. Retry an infrastructure failure in a new
bounded invocation without cleanup, preserving completed independent results.
Do not restart passing platforms or package suites just because another stage
failed. Stop and report a repeated infrastructure failure instead of entering an
unbounded retry loop.

The signed distribution archives are the release compile/signing checks; do not
require two additional Debug device builds merely to permit them. Local device
delivery is a separate operation and may reuse a verified exact-source Debug
artifact. An unavailable device must not block TestFlight. Keep project writers
serial in a worktree; independent device installation and upload checks may run
alongside work that does not mutate their artifacts.
Archives use Xcode's incremental build instead of an unconditional clean.
Artifact identity and export checks still apply to both platforms before upload.

Always retain localization freshness and reviewed translation requirements,
explicit note approval, both-platform archive/export identity and signature
checks, symbol uploads, and actual processing/distribution verification.
Never skip a known relevant failure. Selected-release retries retain their
version/build and use partial-upload receipts instead of starting another build.
Report the current stage and blocker when the plan changes; do not present a
main merge as completion of a still-pending TestFlight release.

### 3. Fail fast — you learn a result in seconds, not minutes

Most tests execute quickly, but `xcodebuild` on this Mac
routinely stalls for minutes in teardown (result bundle + simulator shutdown)
after the tests have already finished. Two things used to turn that into a
~7-minute wait for an answer that existed at second six:

- The stall looked identical to a wedged build, so the no-progress watchdog
  (`PLOZZ_HANG_SECS`, 180s) killed it…
- …and a watchdog kill triggered the from-clean self-heal, which wiped
  DerivedData and **recompiled everything to reprint the same failures**.

`run-tests.sh` now tracks how many test bundles have reported a bundle-level
result (`Test Suite 'X.xctest' passed|failed`). Those lines are flushed as each
bundle finishes — unlike the final `** TEST FAILED **` banner, which is
block-buffered and often only reaches the log once the process is killed. Once
every expected bundle has reported, the script
waits `PLOZZ_VERDICT_GRACE` (default 6s, polled every `PLOZZ_POLL_SECS`=2s) for a
clean exit, then checks for a finalized `xcresult` before reaping teardown. A
from-clean retry is now only attempted when the run produced **no** results at
all — the case it was actually meant for.

The poll interval matters as much as the grace: at the original 10s granularity a
20s grace could take 30s to fire, so every *green* run paid up to half a minute
of pure waiting after the last bundle had already reported its verdict.

Measured on `ProviderShareTests` (416 tests): a failing suite went 6m53s → 1m12s
(including the isolation retry), a passing suite ~10min → 29s.

Set `PLOZZ_VERDICT_GRACE=0` to check results as soon as the bundles report.
`PLOZZ_RESULT_TIMEOUT` (default 660 seconds) bounds result finalization after the
last bundle reports, allowing Xcode's 600-second simulator diagnostic collection
to finish. This is a ceiling, not a fixed wait. A readable result bundle is
always required; reaching the grace period alone never interrupts its writer.

Large scale fixtures emit unbuffered checkpoints from completed work. The
million-programme XMLTV test reports preparation phases and every 10,000 indexed
programmes, so a slow, progressing import is not mistaken for a stalled build.
The 800,005-entry IPTV HTTP import likewise reports every 10,000 staged entries
and every completed 10,000-row database-copy batch through the real importer
progress callback, followed by commit/query/reopen checkpoints. All copy batches
remain inside one transaction; a failure or cancellation restores the previous
catalogue and freshness state, and other connections cannot see partial results.
Both workloads, their assertions, and the no-output watchdog remain
intact. No timer emits artificial progress while an operation is stuck.

### Simulator readiness and authoritative results

`NavigationLibrariesDetailViewTests` hosts the navigation arrangement editor
inside a `List` without a navigation environment object. Both shells must pass
their current profile's `NavigationStyleSettingsModel` explicitly. The test also
checks that an unrelated ancestor model cannot redirect edits to another profile.
On iOS, Settings can be hidden from the tab bar because page-header controls
remain available. The default tvOS policy still keeps Settings visible.
`NavigationStyleSettingsStoreTests` covers cross-platform persistence, the
last-destination safeguard, and iPhone overflow labels when six tabs are enabled.
On iPhone and compact iPad layouts, overflow uses four direct native tabs plus a
Plozz More destination with themed shortcut rows. Overflow destinations share
that tab's navigation stack; Settings opens its existing sheet directly.
Returning to More stops the hidden Live TV preview, and changing the enabled
order re-resolves the current destination. Regular-width iPad tabs remain native.

The focus host and test bundle share one `AppShell` package product. Overlapping
direct products can promote `CoreUI` into a separate framework on XCTest's
`DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`, shadowing Apple's private framework and crashing UIKit
asset loading; different package roots can also duplicate runtime classes.
The default hosted build directory is `focus-shared-root-derived-data`, keeping
stale frameworks from the old graph out of the loader path without deleting them.
Hosted runs preserve raw output, reuse an explicitly configured package checkout,
and disable automatic system-diagnostic collection without skipping tests or
result bundles. An unreadable result preserves the original command failure.

Before starting XCTest, the runner waits for `simctl bootstatus -b` to finish,
including BackBoard and the system app. A simulator marked Booted can still be
initializing those services; starting SwiftUI image rendering too early can
abort or hang inside UIKit's display initialization. Startup is bounded by
`PLOZZ_SIM_BOOT_TIMEOUT` (300 seconds by default), and a failed boot stops the run.

Bundle-level console summaries only trigger the teardown grace period. XCTest
can restart after a crash, skip the crashed test, and print a passing summary
for the survivors. Every invocation therefore gets a unique retained result
bundle under `$PLOZZ_TEST_RESULTS_DIR` (by default `.build/test-results/`),
outside DerivedData and Xcode's rotating log store.
The runner reads its structured summary with `xcresulttool` and fails closed
when results are missing, unreadable, empty, or failed. Reaping a completed
driver cannot turn a recorded crash into success. Named failures can receive
the normal isolated retry only after every requested bundle reported.

Runner verdict regressions use the existing host-side unittest runner:
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p 'test_xcresult_summary.py'`.

## App-hosted focus integration

Episode-panel fixtures activate native window focus before reissuing their
SwiftUI Browse entry request. Repeated window handoffs must start on Browse and
still allow the playing episode to receive actual native focus.

`PlayerSkipMarkerHostedTests` updates one live scrub track and waits for stable
rendered frames before comparing native fills. Liquid Glass can keep changing
after layout; comparing its first frames must not be mistaken for a marker color
regression or worked around by relaxing the pixel assertions.
Capture at the window's native display scale and sample every backing pixel in
the asserted point ranges. Downsampling a 2x TV render to 1x introduces ringing
even around plain opaque capsules; a separate capsule fixture protects snapshot
fidelity. Native-resolution captures retain three consecutive unchanged-frame
comparisons within a six-second capture budget; pixel tolerances stay unchanged.

`SettingsSubtitleContrastHostedTests` measures rendered text and glyph contrast
while native focus moves between shared settings rows in Black, Dark, and Light.
It covers the media-share discovery subtitle, leading icons, manual-entry chevron,
explicit primary text, and `SettingsIconLabelStyle`. Shared `.plozzForeground`
tiers must inherit the inverted row foreground, then return to the normal palette
on blur; text outside a row must remain unaffected. Body text requires 4.5:1
contrast and supporting glyphs require 3:1 against their rendered surface.

`ShareFolderBrowserHostedTests` opens the real unified share screen with 1,551
instant-response folders, bounds main-actor stalls, and verifies returning to
the original root without widening its browse boundary. Deep scrolling must
realize onscreen native focus targets. The bounded folder viewport uses recycled
native cells: fewer than 20 are visible for the large fixture, short lists retain
their natural height, and the table/cells do not clip horizontal focus overflow.
This is isolated UI coverage, not a live-server network benchmark.

`ShareFolderNavigationTests` launches `PlozzFocusHost --share-folder-fixture`
with the same 1,551-folder production picker. It drives real remote Down input,
checks exact item advancement, opening/returning to a folder, and primary-action
focus restoration. Its Black-mode screenshot checks both focus-card overhangs
outside the label bounds. Native `XCTHitchMetric` collection requires tvOS 26+
and physical hardware for meaningful timing; inspect the retained duration,
count, and time-ratio measurements separately from XCTest's functional verdict.
One measured eight-press iteration also runs XCTest's eight-press warmup.
Accessibility queries and screenshot capture stay outside the measured window.
For an attached profile, `PLOZZ_FOLDER_REUSE_FIXTURE=1` requires the fixture to
already be foreground and avoids launching/terminating it.

`DiagnosticRecordingStatusHostedTests` exercises real Darwin notifications and
the visible acknowledgement, preserving native focus while showing the badge.
It checks the render-server expiry animation, eventual removal, and receipt
while a full-screen presentation detaches the app root from its window. Recorder
control tests run with
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p test_trace_device.py`: failed
readiness/visibility must not send input, a sustained recording permits exactly
one input, app-bound runner metadata is refused, and sample verification must
resolve the target PID rather than count unrelated system activity.
`PhysicalDiagnosticInputTests` is opt-in; it never launches the app and remains
outside ordinary unattended test runs. `tools/trace-device.sh` controls the
single-Select recording path. Its separate repeated-Down test requires
`PLOZZ_CAPTURE_FOLDER_DOWN=1`, `PLOZZ_CAPTURE_BUNDLE_ID`, an already-foreground
app, the subfolder heading, and a focused folder row. It supports the legacy
folder-icon buttons and the native `share-location:` cell identifiers. XCTest
adds a warmup, so expect sixteen Down presses in total, not eight. Host shell
variables need the `TEST_RUNNER_` prefix when forwarded through `xcodebuild`.
Its separate status-inspection method uses `PLOZZ_CAPTURE_INSPECT_STATUS=1`
and `PLOZZ_CAPTURE_BUNDLE_ID` to retain the actual TV badge screenshot and
accessibility tree without sending input.

The `PlozziOSPresentationTests` scheme supplies a separate iOS app scene for
native Form/picker and sheet rendering. Run it on an explicitly owned iOS
simulator under the shared build lease, with a lane-private package workspace
and retained result bundle. Its host and tests share only the `AppShelliOS`
package product. `ServerSetupPresentationTests` checks rendered primary-button
text in all themes, the native provider picker's logo bounds, and transparent
WebDAV badge edges. `SettingsCommunityPresentationTests` renders the actual
compact Settings root on phone-sized windows and the regular About page in
both themes, checking that Discord, GitHub, and the QR disclosure remain
reachable. The host includes the app's logos and release-note catalog so these
checks exercise the real settings content, not an isolated QR-card fixture.
The received-setup summary is exercised with 25 servers,
multiple sign-ins per server, and 40 profiles on compact/large phones, landscape,
iPad-sized windows, accessibility text sizes, and right-to-left layout. Its
primary action stays in the bottom safe area while the full summary scrolls;
server names, usernames, profile names, and the final instructions wrap.
Empty and single-profile summaries keep the same reachable action. These tests
use synthetic received data, not pairing services or stored household credentials.
Package-only UIKit snapshots cannot replace this gate:
without an application scene, `drawHierarchy` returns an empty image.

`ProfilePickerPresentationTests` covers compact/adaptive avatar sizing, small
and large households, themes/gradients, landscape, iPad, accessible names and RTL.
Hosted animation frames check the stagger and settled scale; Reduce Motion
reveals every tile immediately. `ProfilePickerInteractionTests` exercises
selection, cancellation, reopening, Edit/Done, long-press editing, separate
adult/kids creation entry points, and launch/restricted management visibility.
Its fixture disables sync and uses only synthetic host-sandbox profiles.

`DownloadActivityLifecycleTests` and `DownloadNotificationDeliveryTests` cover
continued-processing admission, expiration, profile retirement, real-progress
finalization, and durable notification replay without requesting notification
permission. Their scheduler and notification clients are injected. The opt-in
`testSystemActivityReceivesRealHTTPDownloadProgressOnDevice` additionally requires
an owned physical iPhone/iPad on iOS/iPadOS 26 or later and
`TEST_RUNNER_PLOZZ_VERIFY_SYSTEM_DOWNLOAD_ACTIVITY=1`. It uses the host's own
continued-processing identifier and a bounded loopback HTTP fixture, never
stored accounts or user downloads. Simulator runs skip this system-admission
check; that skip is not device proof.

Activity progress tests distinguish the current item's measured stage from the
equal-weight overall indicator. Native subtitle checks cover episode and legacy
metadata, unknown sizes, preparation, finalization before completion, parallel
work, and completed/paused/failed queues. Episode handoffs must update the same
activity only after the preceding record is finalized; do not round an unfinished
transfer up to 100% or select an arbitrary item when several are active.
Native title/subtitle assertions keep media names and episode codes out of the
progress line. Sequential work uses a one-based current step, independent of
registry ordering; paused/failed peers and parallel work use explicit completed
counts instead. Preparation and finalization must never be labeled transferring.

`DownloadNotificationNavigationTests` checks versioned, credential-free routing
payloads, exact item generations, batch/show/season destinations, cold-start
readiness, profile authorization and cancellation, deleted profiles, and
single-consumer delivery. Its hosted tab check opens and replaces notifications
through direct, More, and manually hidden Downloads layouts without changing
saved navigation preferences. Only the rebuilt navigation stack may consume a
tap; a retiring Downloads view must not steal it before the new page appears.
Back navigation must not reopen a consumed notification. These checks do not
claim physical notification-center tap coverage.

`ManagedDownloadResumeTests` exercises the real background HTTP engine and
download queue against a bounded local fixture, with and without an ETag.
It checks that pause/resume preserves progress, issues no second full-body GET,
and produces byte-identical output. Descriptor checks cover legacy JSON ordering
and escaping, malformed identities, and profile/item/file isolation. HTTP and
HLS task lookups, callbacks, cancellation markers, and persisted HLS locations
must use the same canonical identity, including for tasks saved by older builds.

`DownloadPresentationTests` checks that changing rates and ETAs do not change the
active-queue summary's height at phone and tablet widths, with separate coverage
for accessibility text and right-to-left layouts. Live storage and transfer
sections own their record observation: progress must not invalidate the settings
view that constructs native picker menus. Actual preference changes must still
update those controls.
Compact download rows have bounded normal-text heights, expanding failure text,
and accessibility/RTL coverage. Hosted library and show checks verify visible
row density and season metadata. Native tab checks drive progress, completion,
reordering, and removal/reinsertion: only Downloads may change its image, while
Watchlist keeps its bookmark.
`DownloadsInteractionTests` taps the production library and episode menus,
checks 44-point targets and the compact queue control, returns through one Back
step, and cancels then confirms season deletion without navigating by accident.
Completed library and episode rows retain a spoken "Downloaded" label on the
shared filled download glyph, without visible completion copy or disclosure
chevrons beside their menus. Receiving 100% of bytes still does not confer the
completed state before finalization.
Native geometry checks keep episode artwork aligned with season headings in
both card styles; the framed surface must not add a second content inset.

The `PlozziOSInteractionTests` scheme adds real native touch coverage for Settings
on both an owned iPhone simulator and an owned iPad simulator. It launches the
same presentation host with an explicit settings-fixture argument, exercising
production views rather than copies. The fixture disables cloud sync in its own
sandbox before creating the app model; it does not need shipping entitlements
or stored accounts. Normal presentation-test launches still use the blank host.
The UI-test target depends on that host, not additional package products.

`SettingsInteractionTests` checks navigation from compact and split Settings,
Cards and Display Size, independent theme and playback menus, caption previews
and per-view overrides, and neighboring Home, subtitle, spoiler, Circadian Mode,
and Live TV controls. These tests must synthesize taps: direct accessibility
activation and screenshots alone miss a native List cell intercepting a
neighbor's tap. Keep the shared lease, private package workspace, serial
execution, and retained `xcresult` used by the presentation suite; select
`-scheme PlozziOSInteractionTests -only-testing:PlozziOSInteractionTests/SettingsInteractionTests`
with the explicit owned iOS simulator destination.

`tools/run-focus-tests.sh` runs the `PlozzFocusTests` scheme in a minimal,
separate `PlozzFocusHost` app. It uses the same package code but supplies a real
foreground window scene, which package logic tests cannot provide. The suite
exercises native focus on a loading episode slot and its handoff to an episode
near the end of a 1,000-item row. It uses local fixture artwork, not media servers.
Its 40-minute xcodebuild bound includes cold CI compilation as well as XCTest;
the CI job retains its separate 60-minute outer bound.

Pass `PLOZZ_SIM_ID` to select a simulator. Run `tools/generate-project.sh` after
changing the host or test target. Results are retained under
`.build/focus-test-results/`; the runner requires an authoritative passing
`xcresult` just like the package runner. Both runners execute in CI.

`DetailTopNavigationHostedTests` pushes a full-height detail hero through native
top tabs, the native sidebar, and a standalone navigation stack. It checks the
physical top edge and horizontal gutter after navigation, late metadata, action
focus changes, scrolling to Cast, and reopening. The shared
`DetailTopSafeAreaBreakout` must remove the actual navigation inset rather than
subtracting a fixed overscan margin. Its artwork-first reveal is checked with
rendered pixels and live focus targets, including the Reduce Motion path.

`CinematicDetailTransitionHostedTests` exercises the card-to-artwork compositor
over a real navigation stack. It checks the actual expanding and shrinking
frames, artwork-only pause, ordered foreground stages, early Back, direct-play
bypass, missing/replaced source fallback, nested-page ownership, and removal of
input guards and visual covers. Real framed and borderless poster tests also
check that the source crop excludes the caption under Reduce Transparency.
The entrance uses 400ms for the zoom, a 250ms visible-artwork pause, and overlapping
240ms foreground reveals spaced 120ms apart. Shows reveal the episode browser
after the controls, retaining the navigation guard through its final 240ms fade;
movies do not acquire that extra stage. Back uses a 280ms return without
the pause. Reduce Motion bypasses the custom sequence and its input wait.
Source snapshots are per-activation, not per-frame; full-window covers are
released at the artwork handoff, and the small return-card image is scoped to its page.
The opening uses an asymmetric cubic curve with a quick pickup and gentle landing,
without overshoot. The early artwork blend belongs to that same property animator,
so pausing or canceling the zoom also pauses or cancels the blend. Foreground
reveals use the matching curve with 10-point travel; timings and reveal order are
unchanged. Hosted checks cover curve monotonicity and coordinated pause behavior.

`DetailTransitionVisualRegressionTests` uses the production show page and real
poster cards. It asserts that the outgoing thumbnail is transparent within the
first third of the zoom and is never reused as a loading backdrop. The resolved
detail image joins the expansion as soon as it is available. Reverse endpoints
are compared against rendered focused-artwork pixels for framed/borderless and
outlined/highlight cards; corner radii scale with the artwork and use continuous
corners. The source's focused rectangle and radius are captured at activation;
native UIImageView artwork uses its public `focusedFrameGuide`, since the painted
focus expansion need not appear in the image layer's transform.
Back starts toward that shape immediately while native focus restores underneath.
A replaced source or changed window size uses a nonspatial fallback. A temporarily
unrealized source still returns to its captured shape without waiting for focus.
The episode browser keeps its layout while masked until its final reveal and
cannot take entry focus during a whole-show entrance. Episode-context opens
retain their existing initial-focus behavior; Reduce Motion reveals it directly.
Its rendered keyline check waits for native focus completion and the artwork's
painted width to settle, then compares artwork and About in one captured frame.
The settling condition is independent of x-position, so real misalignment still
fails. Native/custom focus paint can outlive focus callbacks; fixed sleeps and
separate snapshots can compare different stages of that return. Retain the exact
measured images and the one-pixel alignment tolerance.

When its real backdrop is ready, opening motion starts in card/router activation,
before creating the detail page. An empty destination must not animate: a cold
request keeps the existing source image until the real preview is available,
then starts the same zoom. There is no substitute image or added loading screen.
A late destination adopts an in-flight entrance rather than replaying it.
Render-server snapshots avoid a full-window bitmap draw on the main thread.
The hosted tests also delay destination mounting and withhold return focus to
verify that neither creates a new pre-animation wait.

Prepared title routes use `withCinematicDetailNavigation` to commit the real
stack change without a second native navigation animation. Unprepared routes
retain their normal animation. A UIKit appearance observer keeps the opening
cover until both the artwork has landed and the destination has appeared.
Production detail pages also wait for a displayed backdrop preview before
starting the 250ms pause and title/button reveals. Full-resolution upgrades do
not restart that sequence. Exhausted artwork candidates release the cover and
controls without a picture; Back remains available while artwork is pending,
and a playing trailer satisfies backdrop readiness without waiting for a still.

Known movie/show backdrops warm after 80ms of stable card/hero focus, with only
one unclaimed focus warmup active and image work on the background lane. The
warmup preserves provider priority rather than pinning a provisional fallback.
The exact preferred preview is retained under its policy-qualified preview key
and can paint the first frame at selection. If selection happens during lookup,
navigation adopts that lookup and uses foreground image loading; it does not
start another provider lookup or let focus loss cancel the selected request.
Blur/disappearance cancels unclaimed work. A full-quality upgrade keeps the
chosen reference, including when the upgrade fails.
The row's older library-only backdrop warmer skips these movie/show cards,
so it cannot compete with the policy-selected request for a different image.

Selection starts any still-needed first-paint request, scoped to the navigation
and joined by the destination. Its preview can feed the expansion before the
page mounts. Poster-only discovery still waits for its authoritative
enrichment. `ArtworkResolutionState` relays the displayed image itself (including
cached and fallback previews) and terminal failure, rather than making the
transition wait for a final-resolution URL callback and another cache lookup.
Focused regressions check request adoption, preview delivery within 500ms,
late-artwork ordering, failure, trailer readiness, and Back during the wait.

`PlozzHomeFixtureTests` builds the real Home view with local provider/artwork data
and drives native left/right/up/down movements without manual input. It is an
isolated simulator workload, not an emulation of an older TV's processor.
`ArtworkLatencyDiagnosticsTests` is separately opt-in: explicit environment
paths identify a sanitized Home snapshot and a local configuration bundle; its
attachment records provider lookup/image durations, never credentials.

`LibraryChannelActionsRemoteTests` drives real guide menus and playback controls
with local channel data and a test engine. It checks show/movie identity delivery,
player teardown on navigation, and display-policy permission across preview,
fullscreen and return-to-guide. These are policy/UI checks, not measurements of
an HDMI handshake. Native menu actions are accessibility cells, while the channel
menu's actual focus can belong to a descendant of its labeled button.
`LiveChannelOutputGroupTests` covers independent audio/display ownership and
prevents uncommitted previews from inheriting a departed display owner. Library
schedule/session tests cover original-account navigation, paused program
identity and immediate authorization revocation.
They also reproduce a ready decoder with a provisional zero clock, readiness lost
during a corrective seek, and exact three-second end-boundary tolerance.
`ChannelPositionReadinessHostedTests` generates its own small local video and uses
the real Plozzigen decoder in a visible window. It checks nonzero-start readiness
and retained preview/display-policy reloads without mistaking them for movie
completion. Its temporary media is removed after the test; it is not an HDMI
hardware acceptance test.
`GuideVerticalNavigationRemoteTests` uses the production recycled guide with a
wide movie above shorter programs. It checks current-program Up/Down entry,
offscreen rows and no-guide content, deliberate horizontal handoff to native
navigation, and the Now reset. Row focus eligibility participates in the cached
row revision so only affected visible rows are rebuilt. The collection's optional
focus delegate has no superclass implementation to call.

Back restores the captured source page behind the moving artwork immediately,
not a snapshot of the outgoing detail page. The popped content stays hidden
through teardown. The cover remains until both reverse motion and the real pop
finish; source scroll offsets and focus are restored beneath it before removal.
The return waits for UIKit's transition coordinator and crosses one render
boundary before requesting focus: navigation's deferred after-commit focus reset
must finish first, or it can overwrite an already-focused source card. This is a
one-shot display callback, not a timed retry or navigation cooldown; forced
teardown and app deactivation cancel it. Recreated cards are resolved by stable
item identity within the surviving source scroll container, then by captured
geometry. Non-card routes retain their captured focus target.
Home and detail hero focus handlers ignore these restoration events rather than
starting another scroll/recede animation. Ordinary user-driven timing is unchanged.
Coverage deliberately delays the pop by 700ms (longer than the reverse animation),
checks both spatial and nonspatial covers, restores a displaced scroll offset,
and observes actual UIKit navigation animation flags. Window-scoped ownership
keeps the return alive after the SwiftUI page is removed, then releases it at
handoff. The source snapshot is also released on a memory warning.

Pinned navigation's passive arrow/swipe observers must honor the cinematic
input gate: a consumed Left is not an unresolved page boundary. Capture the
window's input epoch at gesture start and recheck it before any deferred rail
action, so work queued across a transition cannot open navigation afterward.
The native Search boundary observer and explicit sidebar-open requests use the
same gate. Visual completion does not release a held press or touch: suppression
drains through its end/cancellation and the rest of that event's observers.
Fresh input works without a cooldown; Back remains native, and app deactivation
or forced teardown removes the guard immediately. `PinnedReturnInputHostedTests`
covers blocked/queued Left, held and mixed input, swipe epochs, fresh navigation,
and the real pinned-edge callback changing UIKit focus.

Input filtering is not enough to exclude native Up/Down focus moves. The pinned
shell registers its observable `NavigationChromeModel` with the window:
opening hides the rail immediately; return can draw the rail but disables every
row and page button through input release. Those visibility changes do
not run a second chrome animation beneath the cinematic cover.
Presented detail sessions also hold chrome ownership independently of delayed
stack-depth reports, releasing it on dismissal/disappearance. A late appearance
callback cannot let a closing page reclaim that ownership. Source layout is
resolved before focus restoration. Native commands have distinct generations,
wait for an attached, sized, enabled control, and announce the SwiftUI focus owner
only when that control is eligible. Repeating a request does not depend on a
Boolean changing from false to true. Ordinary native focus observations remain
separate from commands, preventing navigation snapback.
`PinnedChromeTransitionHostedTests` queries the real rail's native focus targets,
checks hiding through zero-depth reports, and covers explicit source-focus
requests and recreated-card lookup. `NativeFocusRequestHostedTests` covers repeat,
pre-mount, and disabled-control commands with a competing native card.

Fresh processes start on Home with the pinned rail's real rows unfocusable until
explicit navigation entry. Scene selection remains available during same-process
root reconstruction (including add-server/profile flows); explicit routes and
standalone Live TV admission retain their priority. `DetailReturnFocusRemoteTests`
starts on the production Home hero with navigation closed, then opens and closes
real detail pages repeatedly, including moving to a neighboring source card.

Pinned rail ends use non-focusable layout spacing, not invisible focus bumpers.
Up at Profile and Down at the last destination retain the actual item's focus;
there is no deferred bounce/recenter or artificial held-focus styling.
`PinnedRailBoundaryTests` drives repeated and held native remote input against
short and long production rails, checks both ends, and verifies Right still
returns to page content. It also captures the profile name after top-boundary input.

`NavigationDestinationHandoffTests` records native content-button focus while
the production rail switches between delayed Home, Music, and Settings pages.
It rejects any focus visit to the outgoing page, covers reselecting the current
page, and holds readiness explicitly while replacing a pending destination or
pressing Right. The rail remains usable until the latest matching page is
presented; no invisible focus target or fixed navigation delay is introduced.
New-page completion requests the first visible content control while retaining
the focused navigation row until that request runs, instead of dropping focus
into the expanded rail's nearest neighbor. A multi-card fixture checks that the first card,
not the second card beside the expanded menu, receives entry focus. Right-return
to the already-selected page retains its existing behavior.

`NativeSidebarHandoffTests` distinguishes Select from Right using stock native
tabs and the production Home hero. Select must enter the chosen destination
without visiting Home's measured focus region. Right closes native navigation
and returns to the current page without selecting a different highlighted tab;
that return also acts as a positive control for the recorder. The incoming test
control deliberately occupies a disjoint region, because retained tab content
can share a hosting ancestor. These focus checks do not rule out a transient
visual highlight or establish physical Apple TV behavior.

Native Sidebar wraps every content destination in `NativeSidebarFocusDestination`.
Selection begins a generation-checked handoff before the binding changes; inactive
and not-yet-presented pages cannot accept focus. The shared presentation anchor
waits for `viewDidAppear` and a render boundary before enabling the selected page.
Native tab transitions and sidebar controls remain system-owned. Revisited tabs
use the same gate; reselecting the current tab does not wait for another appearance.
Hosted tests hold destination mounting while checking outgoing focus eligibility,
and remote tests reject focus arriving before the handoff completes.

Card focus has three independent options: System (native tvOS projection),
Highlight (custom sheen/lean) and Outline (custom glass). Absent per-profile
preferences use System; saved `highlight` and `outlined` values are not migrated.
The System path uses actual TVUIKit media controls: `TVPosterView` for media
Posters and `TVCardView` for composed Cards and read-only information. Images are
assigned to `TVPosterView.image`, never directly to its internal image view.
The shared artwork loader remains responsible for caching, provider selection
and spoiler-safe sources; a stable poster control stays mounted while it loads.
Native poster controls render artwork only, without a TVUIKit footer.
`SystemPosterCaption` owns the title/subtitle layout below the image;
actual native focus observations select primary or secondary text brightness.
Its fixed-height slot reserves the density-scaled caption drop. A separate
vertical animation moves the labels down on focus and returns them on blur,
reversing from the current presentation position when interrupted. The model
always contains the latest focus destination, not a deferred completion write.
Reduce Motion applies the destination without animation.
`MediaRowEpisodeEntryHostedTests` samples caption pixels from the window's
presentation-layer tree rather than repeatedly snapshotting the whole UIKit
hierarchy during the short focus animation. A separate animated-marker/jump
control verifies that the sampler detects real intermediate positions without
inventing them. Glyph travel, row stability, and Reduce Motion assertions remain
unchanged.
Short captions are centered; overflowing captions reuse the existing marquee
speeds and reading pauses. Plain labels own a removable Core Animation
translation with a resting model position, so blur restores the text immediately
without awaiting a task or retaining an interrupted SwiftUI scroll.
The native image carries accessible title/subtitle metadata, while the visible
caption is hidden from accessibility to avoid duplicate announcements.
Badges and resume controls live in the documented image overlay. Series artwork
extension and spoiler blur are content preparation only, not focus effects.
`PosterCaptionRemoteTests` measures painted text bands in screenshots before
and after held/reversed navigation and metadata changes. It requires inactive
captions to be dim, the focused caption to be bright, and title/year baselines
to follow only their own focus, returning fully after rapid reversals.
A long-title case verifies that the marquee
still moves, resets on blur, and does not widen the artwork. Only the artwork's
focus expansion, projection and lighting remain system-owned; captions no longer
depend on interrupted native footer animations or appearance resets.
Prepared poster images use the displayed content size in points and the device
display scale in pixels. TVUIKit derives focus growth from the image, so raw
high-resolution cache dimensions must not become the poster's logical size.
For original artwork, adjust UIImage point-scale metadata without redrawing the
pixels or changing their alpha channel. Only extended/blurred content is rendered.
Pin decorations to the native overlay container with constraints; do not rewrite
their frames during native focus layout.
`TVCardView` hosts live content in its documented `contentView`. Neither control
overrides `focusSizeIncrease`, adds transforms or manufactures lighting/outlines.
Home Libraries use the shared `NativeArtworkPoster` in System focus, with 16:9
artwork owned by `TVPosterView` and `SystemPosterCaption` outside the native
surface. Neither library nor server text may become part of a `TVCardView`.
The native artwork carries accessible names (including localized synthesized
library names) and the original selection action; the caption reserves its own
focus travel without scaling or changing the row footprint. Existing music
callers retain the shared poster's square default.
Custom Highlight/Outline Library cards keep their inner artwork clip so
fill-scaled images cannot cover card padding or caption spacing.
`NativeLibraryCardHostedTests` loads controlled loopback artwork into real Library
cards inside lazy rails, checking aspect ratios, unchanged slot widths, caption
separation, native activation, missing artwork, and custom card geometry across
framed/borderless modes and standard/compact density.
The documented `cardBackgroundColor` uses the active theme's raised surface,
and hosted text retains that same theme rather than being forced into Light.
TVUIKit still owns the state-dependent alpha, projection and lighting. This keeps
detail information and attribution surfaces from becoming pale platters in a dark
app. Borderless information groups retain padding inside the native surface,
without borrowing the custom focus style's extra column gutter.
Card fitting
honors finite width proposals; unspecified-width probes must not install the
10,000-point expanded fitting size as the card's content width.
Sizing queries are read-only: SwiftUI can ask for a zero/minimum width after it
has already measured the eventual placement. Changing `TVCardView.contentSize`
inside that query shrinks live content to the probe (for example 135pt inside a
300pt slot), cropping labels and replaying apparent reveals on later layout passes.
Only `NativeTVCard.Container.layoutSubviews` commits the actual placed bounds.
Hosted information-card regressions repeat those probes under animated parent
updates, require stable pixels and dimensions, and verify real score changes still
render. Do not suppress all child animations or discard metadata updates to mask it.
Loading shimmer's repeat must be scoped to its gradient stripe with
`.animation(_:value:)`, not started by a broad repeating `withAnimation` in
`onAppear`. A device reproduction showed native Details/Playback text opacity
and rating-label bounds cycling every 2.3 seconds with **zero** card updates,
fitting calls, or layouts. That was a separate fault from sizing probes: the
loading repeat had escaped into native-hosted content. Isolating the stripe
stopped both the observed symptom and the recorded layer changes.
Hosted tests also keep the shimmer itself animated, exercise deactivate/reactivate,
and require sibling information pixels to remain stable. The existing Reduce Motion
branch remains a static dim without an animated stripe.
Simulator refresh tests alone did not reproduce that device-only leakage.
Unspecified-height queries use compressed Auto Layout fitting, not an expanded
height: flexible rating labels otherwise become 10,000 points tall and inflate
the About column's text measurements. A non-focusable container reports the visible
content size to SwiftUI and positions TVCardView's intrinsic focus outsets outside
that slot. The resting plate therefore aligns with its section heading; native
focus can still expand beyond it without changing layout.
The poster adapter likewise keeps native horizontal focus outsets outside its
SwiftUI width. Its container lays out the native control at its intrinsic size
but reports only the requested artwork width. Otherwise a surrounding stack
feeds the outsets back as artwork width, enlarging posters and consuming row
spacing. `NativeFocusRequestHostedTests` compares artwork sizes and gaps in
production `MediaRowView` rows against the pre-caption-separation adapter for
portrait, landscape, and Continue Watching layouts. It also checks caption
animation interruption, unchanged layout height, and Reduce Motion.
`NativeInformationCardHostedTests` covers
the actual information grid with a long synopsis and four ratings, checking
bounded, stable card dimensions. `NativeFocusRequestHostedTests` compares the
actual resting `contentView` bounds against its SwiftUI layout container.
Native card measurement also supports unspecified-width proposals from horizontal
music rails, using the content's intrinsic size rather than a zero-sized container.
Poster containers remeasure when TVUIKit settles its intrinsic focus clearance
during native layout, preserving artwork height as well as width.
Fixed-width information cards retain their constrained measurement path.
System-focus music artwork uses the same native poster and separate caption
components as video cards, without a generic card platter behind the captions.
Music browse actions are ordinary native buttons rather than cards wrapping
another background. Music rails allow native focus overflow.
The standalone native monogram adapter prepares square, circular-alpha image
data; production avatar controls use the scoped custom treatment instead.
System bypasses app-defined focus surfaces, edge strokes, resting shadows and
focused z-index changes. Custom Highlight/Outline retain their styling.
Horizontal rails do not clip native focus overflow.
Caption movement is independent of the genuine native artwork focus effect.
The season bar's outer reveal mask preserves the same focus overflow as its
scroll boundary, so a focused edge chip is not clipped during the reveal.
In the season episode row, the System focus owner encloses only the thumbnail
and its artwork badges, not the title or synopsis below it. The episode thumbnail
and interactive loading/retry placeholder use TVPosterView under System.
Cast/artist portraits and
profile avatar controls use the existing circular Outline treatment when System
is selected. `plozzCircularFocusStyle` scopes both the focus owner and its visuals;
it does not change the saved preference or ordinary media-card focus. Existing
Highlight/Outline selections remain unchanged. Regular media poster captions retain the existing density-aware
title/subtitle font sizes. Captions add no resting gap below the native image's
reserved focus frame. This zero-point gap is constant across display densities;
focus travel has its own reserved space.
Neither animation progress nor native footer insets resize the caption layout.
Rows that reserve a subtitle line keep it even when the year/subtitle is absent,
so folder and media cards retain equal heights. Captionless episode controls
keep their existing geometry. Custom Highlight/Outline retain
their existing whole-column focus routing and artwork-only visuals.
`CastFocusRemoteTests` uses the real cast row with full names and portrait-shaped
images, checks focused image/label bounds and circular corner pixels, and verifies
Select still opens the person. A square image with no name is not sufficient
coverage for this native-monogram regression.

The user-driven device trace captured a `UIKitFocusableFillerItem` owned by the page's
scroll view taking Down while the entrance gate was active. Page scrolling is
disabled during that entrance, then restored on completion; hiding or disabling
lower leaf content did not remove the scroll container's filler.
The browser stays mounted for its staged episode reveal: a 48-point upward
movement and 0.72-second fade at default timing, with a gentle start and stop.
Logo, metadata, and controls use a symmetric ease-in/ease-out curve over 0.45 seconds,
starting after a 0.10-second artwork pause with 0.09-second stage spacing.
Episode duration is independent of those foreground timings. Artwork pickup,
reverse motion, and episode travel remain unchanged, and entrance input stays
gated until the episode reveal finishes.
Lower detail content first mounts after the episode row has received focus and the browser's recede
animation has completed, so rapid early Down presses cannot enter its blank
scroll region. The page remains at least one viewport tall before that reveal.
Explicit episode entry keeps its immediate browser behavior; Reduce Motion uses
an immediate completion. Once revealed, lower content remains mounted so later
navigation preserves its state. No extra hosting controller divides native
button focus from the original page tree.
`DetailTransitionVisualRegressionTests` also moves horizontally between real
episodes during the production browser reveal. The outer page must remain at
zero, the compact logo must retain its 72pt top clearance, and normal scrolling
must be restored afterward. Pixel checks compare the season pill's outer edge,
resting episode artwork, and About's leading keyline. Coverage includes all
card focus styles, explicit episode entry, and scroll-guard
removal without disabling nested rails or overriding an existing entrance gate.
The same production test samples the rail's presented position after completion:
it must stay within one point of its final position. Checking page offset alone
misses the spring's measured 7–8.5pt post-completion movement of the whole browser.

`NativePosterComparisonTests` is an opt-in, simulator-only comparison, enabled by
`TEST_RUNNER_PLOZZ_NATIVE_POSTER_COMPARISON=1` on `PlozzHomeRemoteTests`. It captures
compositor screenshots of bare TVPosterView controls and the production adapter
with the same source pixels/content size in Default and High Contrast modes.
Red image landmarks and yellow overlay landmarks distinguish scaling from
edge cropping. It also isolates initialization order, subclassing, SwiftUI
hosting and overlay-hosting choices without changing production styling.

On tvOS 27, accessing `TVPosterView.imageView` while `image` is nil reproduced a
zero `focusSizeIncrease` that persisted after assigning an image. Image-first
construction retained the native 20-point horizontal / 11-point vertical
expansion defaults for the 400x225 fixture. Reading intrinsic size, subclassing,
SwiftUI hosting and adding a SwiftUI overlay after the image did not cause that
zero. Bare native controls also showed slight image-edge cropping under High
Contrast, so that observation alone is not proof of an app-authored transform.
The production adapter therefore initializes TVPosterView with its image before
accessing imageView. While artwork loads, a cached opaque placeholder supplies
the correct image geometry; it is content, not a replacement focus effect.
Replacing that placeholder keeps the same native control and expansion defaults.

The same opt-in comparison includes `TVMediaItemContentConfiguration.wideCell()`
in stock collection-view cells, updated with the native cell configuration state.
On the tested tvOS 27 runtime, image landmarks grew about 11% in Default mode;
under High Contrast they became about 3% closer while a white outline appeared.
Overlay landmarks stayed almost unchanged under High Contrast. This reproduced
the contrast-specific behavior without Plozz's media adapter or custom focus
styling. The focused frame guide alone is not evidence of actual image growth:
use the captured image/overlay landmarks and screenshots.

Media-card focus uses `PlozzCardFocus`: native focus notifications update ordinary
observed state, while explicit focus requests remain separate. A TVUIKit focus
notification must not write back into `FocusState` and reset the containing scope.
Surfaces with independent focus chrome retain ordinary SwiftUI focus.
`SystemDirectionalFocusTests` drives real remote arrows through production media
rows with a preferred hero above, including horizontal scrolling, direction
reversals and vertical row changes in both card layouts. Programmatically
requesting the next focus target is not an adequate substitute for this test.

`NativeFocusProjectionTests` covers the perspective/Z transform that ordinary
2D layer conversion loses. Real card tests compare the projected artwork's
rectangle and rounded corners against painted pixels through a native pop.
The opt-in `FocusStyleSettingsCaptureTests` runs only on a disposable simulator,
sets the real High Contrast Focus Style, checks the on-screen ring and circular
shape, checks its accessibility label, verifies Select fires once and long press
opens a context menu without selecting, then restores the original setting. Run it
with `TEST_RUNNER_PLOZZ_SYSTEM_FOCUS_CAPTURE=1` on the `PlozzHomeRemoteTests`
scheme after building/installing `PlozzFocusHost`.

Hosted coverage includes actual projected circular artwork, framed/borderless
return geometry and loading-row overflow. These are correctness checks, **not
Apple TV performance evidence**. Before calling System an improvement, compare
all three options on the same physical TV, profile, warm artwork and navigation
sequence (horizontal/vertical moves and rapid reversals). Use the
[performance playbook](performance-debugging.md) to compare hitch ratio, frame
times, main-thread stalls and memory, while checking clipping, captions and
Reduce Motion. Keep Home movement/backdrop timings and networking fixed in the
comparison; do not remove either custom option based on simulator results.

## Managed Jellyfin stream authentication

`ManagedAuthenticatedHTTPResolver` uses Jellyfin's supported `ApiKey` query
parameter, not the legacy `api_key` spelling that newer servers reject when
legacy authorization is disabled. This applies to Music, theme audio, video,
and other managed resources. Emby's `api_key` and Plex's `X-Plex-Token` remain
unchanged. `ServerToggleTests` asserts the canonical Jellyfin parameter alongside
fresh-account resolution and stale-credential rejection. On a Jellyfin server
with legacy authorization disabled, a selected Music track must start and advance
past 0:00 rather than fail with `NSURLErrorDomain -1013`.

## Library held-direction navigation

tvOS library grids retain lazy, paged rendering and use six columns at Default
density; other density presets and Search's column count are unchanged. The
existing bounded metadata-fetch budgets remain independent of this layout change.

On tvOS, System-focus libraries use a `UICollectionView` with reusable
`NativeTVLibraryCell` focus owners and `TVMediaItemContentConfiguration`.
Recycling a focused-control-origin `TVCardView`/`TVPosterView` ended a held Down
gesture after three or four rows even with all 500 items loaded. Reassigning
enabled state, adding focus sections and forwarding presses did not correct it.
Retaining every card corrected the symptom but is not acceptable for large
libraries. The interim SwiftUI-focus/content-configuration bridge preserved the
hold but lost visible native artwork focus on the physical TV. Real UIKit cell
focus and UIKit-delivered configuration state are required; manually setting a
configuration's focused flag is not equivalent.

The native collection observes individual visible `LibrarySlot` objects, reuses
decoded artwork, and cancels cell work on reuse/disappearance. Captions and the
scrolling SwiftUI header stay outside the artwork's projection. Custom focus
styles and iOS retain their existing grids. The shared view model still owns
provider-neutral paging, collections, sort generations, and the A-Z index.

`LibraryHeldScrollTests` drives real remote holds through the production grid,
measures the actual scroll view's offset, checks both framed/borderless native
presentations with preloaded and paged data, and verifies selecting a real item
after fast scrolling. Pending metadata must not prevent the native index from
continuing to scroll. A focused native fast-scroll index is not a lost-focus
failure; requested focus or loaded-slot counts alone do not prove traversal.
After leaving fast scroll, delayed metadata arrival must preserve the current
viewport rather than restore an old offscreen focus preference. Explicit detail
return requests remain separate from this passive preference.
System-grid loading cards use plain gray artwork and caption bars, without
visible loading copy or playback glyphs. They retain their real cell focus
identity and announce Loading to accessibility; selection and context actions
stay disabled until metadata arrives. Skeleton caption lines reserve the normal
font metrics, so filling a card never changes its layout height.
The remote fixture also bounds resident cells and exercises context-menu
navigation, return focus/scroll position, switching to Collections, and a
600-member collection. `NativeGridMediaHostedTests` compares actual painted
poster bounds before/after real collection-cell focus, checks caption separation,
and compares the detail-transition source rectangle with those pixels. Ordinary
non-grid native lockup controls are unchanged. These simulator checks do not
establish physical touchpad behavior or Apple TV frame-time performance.

`NativeLibraryRefreshHostedTests` covers count corrections while scrolled,
same-count catalog updates, cell/selection identity, and retained native focus.
Count-only changes insert/remove tail slots without resetting the collection.
Catalog refreshes update existing `LibrarySlot` objects in place, including the
pages visible when the refresh commits; they must not strand cell observers on
discarded objects.
The issue #15 regression uses 2,178 items and the default 28/42-item paging plan:
load index 1,750, scroll away, refresh the catalog, and return without reopening.
Both the shared model and the hosted native grid must refill the invalidated
off-screen page; the native placeholder must update in place and select the
refreshed item after its delayed page response arrives.

The displayed grid's `contentGeneration` is separate from the first-page/refresh
request token. Only replacing the browsing order invalidates cell callbacks.
Failed background refreshes leave existing callbacks and in-flight page loads
usable, while successful refreshes cancel old page loads before publishing new
slot contents. Mode/sort tests still require retired callbacks to be rejected.

## Extras artwork

Extras rails on tvOS and iOS opt into the shared `CardArtworkPolicy.extra`.
The extra's primary artwork precedes server backdrop selections and legacy
fan-art fallbacks, without changing its provider kind or playback identity.
Generic movie-title artwork enrichment is disabled for extras, including when
online artwork is preferred. Their image-resolution identity is separate from
ordinary cards so an earlier online winner cannot leak into an extra's image.
Rendering and remote prefetch use the same ordered, deduplicated candidates.
Ordinary movie, episode, and spoiler-safe artwork policies remain unchanged.

`ExtrasArtworkPolicyTests` covers distinct thumbnails with a shared parent
backdrop, explicit artwork selections, missing and failed primary images,
authenticated URL preservation, network-file artwork, both online preferences,
and actual rendered pixels after a generic card has cached the wrong image.
Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby provider fixtures independently verify that extras keep
their own primary image paths before the presentation policy selects them.

## Server-defined collections

Movie/TV libraries expose the same horizontal Titles / Collections control for
Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby. Both options stay visible, selection stays distinct
from focus, and moving the remote focus alone does not switch the page.
On tvOS the options form one connected control with a readable material backdrop
(opaque when reduced transparency is enabled) and a selected-segment fill,
without checkmarks or underlines. The library header scrolls with the grid rather than
remaining pinned; mode switching stays available in loading, empty and error
states. The iOS mode control likewise scrolls with loaded content.
Opening a collection uses the same full vertical poster grid as library/folder
browsing, not a detail hero with a horizontal contents rail.
Native Jellyfin/Emby BoxSet roots remain browseable; Plozz
does not add synthetic Collections libraries. Previously cached synthetic Plex
shortcuts are filtered on read and future writes without clearing other Home
or navigation data.

`MediaProvider.collections(in:page:)` discovers collections belonging to a
specific library. It is distinct from collection membership: listing collections
must never filter a collection's contents down to other collections. Mode
switches isolate page counts, sorts, letter offsets and pending requests; stale
callbacks cannot change the newly selected mode. Merged-library providers keep
separate title/collection buffers and forward each original library ID. A failed
collection source remains a retryable error rather than an empty or partial
success.

`MediaProvider.collectionMembers` preserves server ordering. A collection-member
browser loads its first page and fetches later pages as the grid needs them;
it must not fetch the entire collection before displaying its first posters.
Member scope is explicit and distinct from a native Collections library root.
Unavailable sorting and title-letter offsets must not be offered for a
server-ordered member list. Both shells distinguish loading, empty and failed
states and retain retry, navigation and scroll restoration. Server/account ownership stays attached
to every item; a collection's external catalogue ID does not make another user's
collection an interchangeable playback source.

`PlexCollectionBrowsingTests`, `MediaBrowserCollectionBrowsingTests`,
`CollectionDetailBrowsingTests`, `CollectionIdentityTests`,
`LibraryCollectionModeTests`, `AggregatedLibraryCollectionTests`, and
`RetiredCollectionShortcutTests` cover discovery, static/smart membership,
pagination, mixed member kinds, account isolation, retry/cancellation,
mode-switch races, snapshot migration and server-defined ordering.

## Edition and file selection

A named movie edition selected from an individual library card retains its
account/item identity when opening detail. A merged Home/Search representative
is not an explicit edition choice and retains automatic source recommendations.
Both use the same combined detail page and version menu; explicit menu choices
can still switch to another edition or file.

Before opening detail, iOS Home cards and context-menu navigation use
`PlaybackSourceSelection.bestDetailItem`. Applying playback ranking first would
replace the clicked edition before the shared detail policy could preserve it.
Direct-play rows still use `bestPlayItem`; merged and unlabelled detail cards
still receive normal recommendations. `PlaybackSourceSelectionTests` covers
these entry-point distinctions and physical collection/folder identity.

Provider edition labels survive single-file synthesis and persisted metadata.
Picker identities qualify the account, backing item, and intrinsic media ID;
playback receives the owning provider item and its original media ID, never a
synthetic picker ID. Remembered choices must resolve against both qualified
detail candidates and raw provider candidates without crossing owners.
Transient opening intent must not be serialized as a lasting playback choice.
Sparse refreshes preserve known edition facts only for the same source/file.

`EditionPlaybackRoutingTests`, `EditionDetailSelectionTests`,
`EditionDetailViewModelTests`, and `PlexEditionIdentityTests` cover separate
editions with multiple encodings, colliding IDs, synthetic/stale source refs,
explicit overrides, merged-card defaults, snapshot refresh, and exact Plex
playback routing. Existing same-account grouping and version preference tests
remain part of the regression selection.

## Shared custom-dialog appearance

App-owned tvOS guidance, expanded-overview, title-overview, and startup-release-note
dialogs use `PlozzDialogBackdrop` and the shared `.overlay` surface. Dark and Black
dim the underlying page by 85%; Light retains 40%. Startup release notes retain
their 72% minimum in Light and follow the stronger shared dimming in Dark/Black.
Border, fill, and shadow come from `ThemePalette.overlay`, including the subtle
Black-appearance hairline (13% opacity), rather than individual dialog implementations.
Native alerts/sheets retain system-managed dimming; anchored playback menus are
not blocking dialogs and do not gain a screen-wide dimmer.

`DialogSurfaceTests` verifies rendered backdrop pixel values, preserves the
stronger minimum, and checks that the Black border is visible but subtle without
changing layout. Remote guidance tests keep focus, scrolling, and dismissal covered.

## Common Sense Media guidance

The Ratings section keeps Common Sense Media age recommendations separate from
certification labels such as PG-13. Basic `CommonSenseMedia` data comes from the
Plex item-detail response; the full review is requested only when its tile opens,
through the fixed Discover host and global Plex GUID. It is not fetched for
every poster or copied into the external critic-score list.

The tile emphasizes age using the app's standard non-rounded typography, with no
adjacent quality fraction. The supplied Common
Sense mark retains its original colors, with a dark backing on light surfaces.
The disclosure chevron sits inline at the trailing edge of the Common Sense row,
vertically centered with its label, rather than floating in the tile's corner.
The tvOS dialog pins its age/title/summary above separate topic and reading
viewports. Its two-column grid places age beside title/branding, then aligns the
recommended-age caption with the synopsis's first baseline. Wrapped and missing
synopses must preserve that structure without overlapping the reader; touch
layouts retain their vertical stack. Only the selected topic's explanation is
visible. Review scores have
their own page and star treatment; content levels use ticks and retain real zero
versus missing values. On tvOS a clear full-screen presentation hosts one themed
panel over a dim backdrop; do not nest that panel inside a second glass sheet.
Use the shared overlay surface, including its subtle Black-appearance border,
and the theme-aware panel-header button style for Done's focused contrast. Common Sense
branding lives in the header, not a duplicate footer. iOS navigates from the
overview into individual sections.

Hero/header previews default to the Common Sense age plus two available review
scores. The age never consumes a review slot or replaces the official
certification. Home and detail preferences persist independently per profile,
including age visibility and review count; saved source order/selections survive
upgrades, and global hiding/spoiler rules still apply. Full title information
retains all ratings. Existing hero detail enrichment carries basic guidance
without fetching cloud reviews. Episode Home slides use their represented
show's guidance, while the episode play target remains unchanged.

`PlexCommonSenseMediaTests` covers movie/show summaries, absent and episode data,
full category mapping, zero versus missing scores, invalid values, global-ID
validation, and restricted versus unavailable versus failed requests.
`FamilyGuidanceServiceTests` verifies Plex Home uses the active person's cloud
credential, never the owner's fallback, and discards responses after profile,
credential, or source-access changes. Full reviews are sheet-local rather than
shared or persisted across profiles.

`FamilyGuidanceRemoteTests` exercises the real Ratings section with native tvOS
focus: Select opens the review, Menu restores the tile, failed requests can be
retried, and restricted access never renders invented category scores. Opening
long content must keep the large age and summary visible. Both pane viewports
are focus sections; while reading, only the selected menu row remains eligible
for Left return, and the rest reopen when menu focus returns. Arrow presses
scroll the native text reader, alongside its standard swipe handling; regressions
measure paragraph movement in both directions, not just focus retention. Up scrolls
while the reader is below its top edge; once at the top (including short text),
Up can move natively to Done. Down remains in the reader, while Left and Menu retain
their normal exit behavior. The full-width header is also a focus section so Up
from Overview reaches Done. Menu content stays inside its viewport, and the reader
extends into the space freed by removing the footer. Black, Dark, and Light
fixtures cover the sheet edge and readable viewport.
The native text reader must have a rectangular clipped viewport: tvOS gives
`UITextView` a 20pt corner radius by default, which cuts glyphs beneath the heading
when text uses the card's existing padding. `FamilyGuidanceReaderHostedTests`
checks pixels at both top corners, focused and unfocused across scroll offsets,
while ensuring below-viewport content remains clipped. Only the outer card keeps
rounded corners; do not fix this by changing text padding or disabling clipping.
Header regressions cover age-only data, quality-without-age, two-score defaults,
per-profile persistence, hydrated hero-cache invalidation, and touch wrapping at
large Dynamic Type sizes.
The same tile and sheet content are used by iOS; unsupported providers simply
have no guidance tile. New interface copy is localized through the app catalog;
review text and category labels are provider content.

## CI pipeline

Validate workflow edits with `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml` before
pushing. GitHub rejects invalid context references before creating a runner or
job log. CI configuration regressions run without simulator builds:
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p 'test_ci_pipeline.py'`.

### CI lanes and required check

CI first runs every deterministic preflight guard and host-side regression
suite. Successful preflight unlocks **three independent `macos-15` runners**:
the tvOS simulator app build, the complete package test matrix, and app-hosted
focus integration. A failed preflight stops expensive work; a failure in one
build/test lane does not suppress either sibling. There is no change-scoped CI
selection, cache-hit test skipping, or parallel XCTest worker cloning.

The final **`Build and test tvOS app`** check keeps the existing required-check
name. Its `always()` job requires success from preflight and all three lanes.
Failed, cancelled, skipped, missing, or unexpected dependencies fail closed.
Push-to-main, pull-request, manual triggers, and per-ref cancellation remain
unchanged.

Each test runner selects its own tvOS simulator matching Xcode 26.2's SDK; no
simulator or mutable build directory crosses runners. A missing runtime fails
instead of choosing an older installed runtime. The full matrix retains its
40-minute wall-clock deadline, and hosted tests retain their existing
20-minute deadline and authoritative `xcresult` checks. Each lane uploads
uniquely named diagnostics on success or failure, retained for seven days.
The simulator app build also retains its raw log without replacing a build
failure's exit status with the log writer's status.

Baseline CI run `35167378428` / job `105031390432` took 45m7s: approximately
6.3m app compilation, 22m package tests, and 14.7m hosted tests. Only about 2.8m
of the hosted stage was test execution. Parallel lanes remove the sum of those
stages from the critical path; this is not a measured new end-to-end time.
Separate runners cost more concurrent macOS capacity and still repeat some
compilation on a cold cache.

### CI cache ownership and compatibility

`.github/actions/ci-prepare` initializes storage through `tools/ci-cache.py`,
using `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and `GITHUB_ENV` after checkout, not a job-level
`runner` expression or the machine's shared developer caches:

- `.build/ci/<lane>/DerivedData`: a separate app, package, or hosted build root.
  The cache allowlist contains only `Build`, `ModuleCache.noindex`,
  `SDKStatCaches.noindex`, and `CompilationCache.noindex`.
- `.build/ci/<lane>/SourcePackages`: that lane's private mutable checkouts and
  binary artifact extractions. It travels **only with that lane's compiled
  snapshot**, preserving dependency timestamps for incremental compilation.
- `.build/ci/<lane>/source-timestamps.json`: SHA-256, file mode, size, and
  nanosecond timestamps for that successful build's tracked source inputs.
  It travels with the same lane's compiled snapshot, never a separate cache.
- `.build/ci/swiftpm-cache/{repositories,artifacts}`: compressed SwiftPM
  repository/download caches. Every job restores its own copy. Only a
  successful app-build job seeds the remote compressed cache.

No live directory has concurrent writers across lanes; immutable Actions
snapshots are not a shared writable filesystem. Hosted host/test products
remain owned by the single `AppShell` umbrella product. App and package
products must never be copied into the hosted build root: an old independent
`CoreUI.framework` can shadow Apple's private framework and crash UIKit.
The new cache namespace deliberately starts cold rather than importing any
old DerivedData graph.

Keys include the Xcode build, selected developer/SDK paths, SDK version/build,
runner architecture and macOS build, workspace path, XcodeGen version,
`Package.swift`, and canonical `Package.resolved`. Compiled compatibility
additionally hashes `project.yml`, generated project/schemes, configuration
files, CI actions/workflow, and build runner/generator inputs. Metadata
enumeration and reads use no-follow workspace-relative descriptors; linked
configuration or generated-project inputs fail key computation. Only generated
marketing/build **version values** are normalized for the cache fingerprint;
the actual freshly generated project is never rewritten for caching, so Xcode
still rebuilds anything affected by those values. Each compiled snapshot has
an exact commit key and can fall back only within the same lane and complete
compatibility prefix. There is no broader Xcode/SDK/manifest fallback.
Source files are freshly checked out, and every build/test command executes
after restore. A checkout gives unchanged
files fresh timestamps, which can otherwise defeat restored DerivedData.
After restore, `ci-cache.py` reinstates a saved timestamp **only** when a file
is still tracked, its bytes have the same SHA-256, and its size/mode match.
Scope is limited to `Sources`, `Tests`, `App`, `TopShelf`, `Config`, and the
root package/project manifests. Changed, new, deleted, untracked, or
out-of-scope files are not assigned an old timestamp. Directory/file symlinks,
hard links, absolute paths, and traversal are rejected; descriptor-relative
file operations prevent following a swapped symlink outside the workspace.
Missing or corrupt timestamp snapshots leave fresh source timestamps intact.
Only successful trusted-main cache publication records a new snapshot.
Xcode remains responsible for incremental dependency checking.

Restoring a cache is **not proof of avoiding compilation**. Retained package
checkout timestamps and content-verified source timestamps make unchanged
compiled work eligible for reuse, but Xcode may invalidate it for other
reasons. The helper reports how many tracked timestamps it restored; compare
actual compiler tasks and lane durations on real CI runs before claiming a
measured compile-time improvement. No build-free effectiveness claim is made.

Only successful `main` push/manual jobs explicitly save snapshots. Pull
requests and non-main manual runs are restore-only; they can read compatible
default-branch snapshots but do not publish them. This also relies on GitHub's
cache ref scoping: an untrusted pull-request workflow cannot write a cache
visible to trusted main. Checkout credentials are not persisted. There are no
secret inputs, signing identities, profiles, keychains, simulator state,
result bundles, or broad home-directory caches in the allowlist.

Cache misses and eviction must remain ordinary cold builds, never reasons to
skip checks or relax timeouts. Lane-private checkouts/extractions trade storage
and transfer time for reuse of compiled dependencies; three compiled snapshots
can pressure the repository's Actions cache quota. Measure cache hit rates,
restore/save time, and lane duration on real runs before expanding the
allowlist. No cleanup of local/shared caches is part of CI acceleration.

## Guards that run before the compile

Native typography tests compare against the runtime's `UIFontMetrics` behavior:
older tvOS versions keep those metrics fixed, while newer runtimes scale them.
Both paths assert the matching geometry rather than skipping older runtimes.

Both are host-side Python (the tests run inside the tvOS Simulator sandbox and
cannot read the repo tree), both are wired into `run-tests.sh`, `test-fast.sh`
and CI, and both are skippable via an env var for debugging:

| Guard | What it catches | Skip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/arch-guard.py` | forbidden module edges, layering cycles, vendor SDK leaks | `PLOZZ_SKIP_ARCH_GUARD=1` |
| `tools/test-hygiene.py` | tests XCTest will never run | `PLOZZ_SKIP_TEST_HYGIENE=1` |

`test-hygiene.py` exists because a `func testX()` declared **inside another
function** compiles cleanly, reads exactly like a real test in review, and is
never executed — XCTest only discovers methods declared as members of an
`XCTestCase`. The audit that added the guard found three such tests, all of which
pass once hoisted, i.e. three tests' worth of authoring effort that had been
buying zero coverage. Nested XCTestCase *classes* are fine and explicitly allowed
(the ObjC runtime does register them — verified against a real run log).

## Shared test doubles

SwiftPM cannot list one file in two targets, so a double needed by several suites
has to live in its own target or it gets copy-pasted. `TestSupportNetworking`
(`Tests/TestSupportNetworking`, a plain `.target`, not a test target) holds the
ones that were already duplicated:

- `RecordingHTTPClient` — was four byte-identical copies (Trakt/Simkl/AniList/MAL),
  three of which had drifted to name the wrong service in their doc comment.
- `StubURLProtocol` — was two byte-identical copies (HTTP/WebDAV).

Consumers use `@testable import TestSupportNetworking`, so nothing in it needs to
be `public`.

## SOURCE → TEST map (illustrative — computed live, do not hand-maintain)

Each `Sources/<Module>` is covered by `Tests/<Module>Tests` when that test target
exists. Modules with **no** test target (e.g. `FeatureSettings`, `TopShelfKit`,
`CrashReporting`, the metadata `*Service` shims) map to nothing directly but are
still covered transitively by `AppShellTests` and any feature that depends on them.
Run `tools/test-impact.py --list-tests` for the authoritative current list, or
`tools/test-fast.sh --dry-run <Module>` to see what a change would select.

There are currently **38 test targets** covering **4,663 tests**. The list is not
reproduced here on purpose — it went stale the moment it was written (it claimed
23 targets, and named `FeatureSearchTests`, which does not exist). Ask the tool
instead: `tools/test-impact.py --list-tests`.

## Writing tests that stay fast

The audit that produced these numbers found 56 tests (1.2% of the suite)
accounting for 70% of all execution time, and nearly all of it came from three
avoidable habits:

1. **A production delay with no seam.** `RemoteSubtitleAcquisition` polled 4×
   with a hardcoded 700ms sleep, so exercising its exhausted-poll path cost 2.5s
   of pure sleeping. The fix is an injected interval with the production value as
   the default — not a weaker assertion.
2. **A `waitUntil` that returns silently on timeout.** It converts a real
   regression into a green test that merely takes `timeout` seconds, and it
   reports the failure as some confusing downstream symptom. Every wait helper
   must `XCTFail` when its condition never holds.
3. **Sleeping instead of waiting for a signal.** `await waitUntil(timeout: 0.5)
   { false }` — "give the task time to bail" — proves nothing and costs 0.5s
   every run. Wait on an effect the code actually produces (a call counter, a
   published state), then assert what must *not* have happened.

Genuine scale guards (`…ForOneAndTenThousandRecords`, `testLargeMovieRegroup…`,
the FTP socket-timeout tests) are worth their ~1s each and should be left alone.

## Tiered policy — which command when

1. **Inner loop (every change):** `tools/test-fast.sh` — auto-detects changed
   modules and runs only the covering suite(s). Or name them explicitly:
   `tools/test-fast.sh CoreModels FeatureAuth`. Preview with `--dry-run`.
2. **Pre-integration (handing a branch off):** `tools/test-fast.sh` already expands
   foundational changes to the affected set.
3. **Ordinary main landing:** agent-selected checks based on actual risk and
   current evidence; no automatic full sweep. See "Main-gate execution and reuse."
4. **Broad regression / distribution:** full sweep when warranted by the change
   or required by the distribution lane. Existing CI schedules remain independent.

### `tools/test-fast.sh` usage
```
tools/test-fast.sh                 # diff vs merge-base with origin/main
tools/test-fast.sh --staged        # only staged changes
tools/test-fast.sh --base HEAD~3   # diff against a specific ref
tools/test-fast.sh CoreModels …    # explicit module or suite names
tools/test-fast.sh --dry-run …     # print the selection, don't run
```

## Notes / gotchas

- **`swift test` does not work on this Mac** — AetherEngine's FFmpeg binary
  xcframeworks are tvOS-only (no macOS slice), so SwiftPM resolution fails. It
  only runs in the Linux CI container. Locally, always use `tools/run-tests.sh` /
  `tools/test-fast.sh` (tvOS Simulator).
- **`export GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS="'safe.bareRepository=all'"`** before any
  `swift`/`xcodebuild` invocation (the scripts set it themselves).
- **Data-driven, so it survives target churn.** When the WebDAV branch adds
  `MediaTransportWebDAV(+Tests)`, `run-tests.sh`, `test-fast.sh` and
  `test-impact.py` pick it up with no edits; a change to `MediaTransportCore` then
  automatically includes `MediaTransportWebDAVTests` in its impacted set.

## Known issues to fix (do NOT mask by weakening tests)

- **`FeatureHomeTests`** was previously quarantined (a data race in the shared
  `FakeMediaProvider` test double crashed the xctest host and hung the run). Fixed
  by locking the fake's counters; it now runs by default. No assertions weakened.
- The old "flaky Plex network-probe" tests are deterministic (injected `HTTPClient`
  doubles, fake hosts); only the occasional host-launch timing race remains, which
  the runner's retry-once absorbs.
## Opt-in provider playback

Use [the provider playback test lane](provider-playback-tests.md) for actual
Jellyfin, Plex, Emby, and native Silo negotiation → authenticated stream → decoded frames/audio
→ seek/pause/resume → owned cleanup checks. It records startup timings and exact
stream formats without treating HTTP success as playback success. It requires
dedicated fixture items/accounts and explicit simulator ownership.

Normal package runs skip the live methods. The dedicated runner requires every
selected provider to execute and pass, with zero skips, and labels synthetic
contract-fixture runs separately. Silo tests its supported server-selected
conversion, not an unsupported arbitrary bitrate policy. Local shares are out
of scope. All test players are muted before playback begins.
