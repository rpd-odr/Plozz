# Performance Debugging Playbook (tvOS + iOS/iPadOS)

A field guide for diagnosing **slowness, freezes, blank/no-artwork hangs, memory
crashes, UI jank, and focus-navigation lag** in Plozz on a real Apple TV. Written
so any agent or contributor can re-run the same process from scratch. It captures
the methodology, the on-device tooling, how to read an Instruments trace without
the GUI, and two worked case studies (a memory/CPU storm and a SwiftUI re-render
storm) that this process actually solved.

> Golden rule: **get ground truth before changing code.** tvOS performance bugs
> are almost always the opposite of what they look like. "No artwork" was never an
> artwork bug; it was JavaScriptCore garbage collection pinning every core. "The
> whole app is laggy" was a single SwiftUI view re-rendering 4×/second. Measure
> first, theorise second.

## When to use this playbook (invocation)

Reach for this document the moment anyone reports — or you observe — any of:
**"laggy", "janky", "stutters", "slow", "freezes", "hangs", "navigation lag",
"focus feels heavy", "blank/no artwork", "memory crash", "gets killed", "fan
spins", "drops frames"** — or any **live-instance count that climbs and never
falls** (the diagnostics overlay's `Players N · AVPlayer M`), which is a retain
cycle: jump straight to §10.

**Focus missing until the next remote press, or landing on the wrong control?**
Start with [tvOS focus handoffs](#tvos-focus-handoffs-searchsidebar), not a CPU trace.

Most of this playbook was written against the Apple TV, and §0 still holds there
(the TV is the honest signal for *performance*). But it applies to **iPhone and
iPad too** — the July 2026 leak in §10 was iOS-only, and treating this as a
tvOS-only document is exactly why it went unread for two hours. The drill is always the same: **reproduce on the
device → measure with the watchdog and/or `xctrace` → aggregate the trace →
name the subsystem → fix at the source → re-measure.** Do not change code on a
hunch before a measurement names the culprit.

There are two dominant bug **classes** in this app; identify which one you're in
early (the decision tree in §4 routes you):
1. **Resource storm** — memory climbs and/or CPU pegs across cores; often a
   background subsystem (JSC GC, decode, network fan-out). See §2, §6 (Case 1).
2. **SwiftUI re-render storm** — the *main thread* is busy with the SwiftUI
   attribute graph (`AG::Graph::*`, `Attribute.init`, `*.body.getter`) and/or
   Liquid Glass (`SDFLayer`, `GlassContainer`), memory flat, no single heavy
   binary. This is what makes navigation/focus "laggy". See §7, §8 (Case 2).

## Sentry diagnostics and matching symbols

Crash-reporting consent gates all uploads. Automatic UI/network breadcrumbs and
performance tracing remain disabled. Reports retain a bounded history of fixed
screen categories and typed Live TV sync stages; failures include only an
allowlisted reason and, for known system errors, a numeric code. No source/profile
identity, playlist URL, media title, error description or user-info dictionary is
included. Repeated sync failures are reported once per profile/operation/stage
until recovery. Expected schedule deferrals and cancellation are not failures.
Numeric SDK memory measurements and its low-memory flag survive redaction;
device names, installation IDs and arbitrary contexts do not.
The `PLZLTVSYNC` local log uses the same non-secret vocabulary.

Playlist import limit warnings contain only a closed limit category and numeric
observed/maximum counts. Header size, received bytes, parser input, header-line
size and entry count are distinguishable without uploading an address, channel
name, credential, error description or playlist content. Reporting is gated by
crash-reporting consent and limited to one warning per category per reporter
lifecycle. These measurements diagnose an unavailable input; a screenshot of the
generic import error alone cannot establish which limit was reached.

IPTV setup diagnostics are enabled for **all TestFlight builds**, including
hotfixes, and local Debug verification, never App Store builds. There is no
build-number allowlist or automatic build-based expiry; retire the investigation
explicitly once the setup issues are resolved. This is not a remote configuration
switch. They reuse Share Crash Reports (including explicit opt-outs), not the
manual Send Diagnostics action. A handled add/reconnect failure produces a warning with
`report.kind:iptv-setup`; a crash or button press is not required.

Playback failures use the same Debug/TestFlight and Share Crash Reports gate,
with `report.kind:playback-failure`. The IPTV proxy records the upstream HTTP
status and MIME category before converting a failed request to a gateway
response; the live engine records typed error kinds and numeric domain/code
evidence. Reports distinguish response, body, manifest, load, playback and
audio-session failures. Unknown format information stays unknown. URL/header
values, media names, provider addresses and error descriptions are never included.
Each playback attempt emits at most one failure; the reporter accepts at most
10 distinct playback reports per enabled lifecycle, separately from setup
reports. Success, cancellation and downstream client disconnects do not report
proxy failures. Opting out invalidates retained attempts even if reporting is
later re-enabled. These reports diagnose playback separately from catalogue
imports; they do not establish that two users have the same underlying failure.

Only explicit URL, file, and Xtream account setup and legacy source check/save
attempts establish the task-local context. Ordinary catalogue refresh, guide
polling, playback, and browsing do not. Each attempt emits at most 16 stage
breadcrumbs and one terminal breadcrumb. Only failed outcomes create issues:
success and cancellation do not. A reporter lifecycle accepts at most 20 attempts
and 10 distinct failure summaries, deduplicated by source/authentication kind, entry point,
stage, reason, HTTP status, and network code. These are bounded samples, not
population-wide success/failure rates.

The closed payload contains source/authentication categories, add/edit entry
point, phase, outcome, elapsed/phase milliseconds, available entry/skip counts,
the most recently measured playlist input size, request count, final HTTP status,
coarse response MIME category, and an allowlisted reason/numeric network code.
Unavailable measurements stay absent. It never contains URLs, hostnames, account
or profile IDs, filenames, header names/values, credentials, channel names, bodies,
or arbitrary error descriptions. Counters are recorded at parser/library
completion, never per channel; no extra requests, timers, disk logs, or tracing
are added. Restarting reporting invalidates old attempts instead of replaying
them. The final Sentry scrub revalidates every field and preserves only coarse
app/OS/hardware/screen tags and the existing numeric memory evidence.

Missing breadcrumbs in a shared issue or formatted summary are not proof that
the original event contained none. Check the event and its debug images: an app
image with `debug_status: missing` specifically means Sentry lacks its matching
symbols. An unknown framework source location alone does not establish that.

Before distribution, configure `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG` and
`SENTRY_PROJECT` in the private Plozz env file (or CI environment), and install
`sentry-cli`. The `beta` and `release` lanes validate both IPAs, then upload each
archive's UUID-matched app/extension dSYMs and wait for Sentry processing before
uploading either platform to Apple. Source bundles are explicitly excluded.
The uploader verifies every archive debug UUID, including dependencies, through
the configured project's symbol API. This accepts already-processed symbols
without relying on `sentry-cli --require-all`, which can reject existing uploads.
Missing debug information, API failures and redirects still block distribution;
the token must allow reading the project's debug files as well as uploading them.
Local builds/archives do not need Sentry upload credentials.

For an existing retained archive, use
`python3 tools/upload-sentry-symbols.py /path/to/Plozz-tvOS.xcarchive`.
The UUID must match the event's exact binary; rebuilding the same Git commit does
not recreate its symbols. Missing historical breadcrumbs cannot be recovered by
uploading symbols. Symbolication improves attribution, not proof of a hang's cause.

Portable iCloud Keychain publication runs on a dedicated serial utility queue,
including local credential reads and encoding. Unchanged values are not rewritten.
Sign-out and purge use the same queue, invalidate older publications, and hide
pending removals from auto-connect. Turning sync off cancels queued publication;
an already executing Security call cannot be interrupted.

Live TV portable journal commits keep consent checks and authoritative local-store
changes on the main actor, then await atomic file writes on a worker. The journal
revision is fenced until completion, and observation receipts are written after
their records. Cloud capture and acknowledgements cannot report success before
that commit. Failures invalidate preparation and preserve the caller's fallback;
unchanged observations do not trigger another disk flush. Do not fix `fsync`
hangs by removing atomic writes or returning before persistence finishes.

## 0. The Apple TV is the only honest signal

- The Simulator does **not** reproduce these problems. CPU, memory pressure, the
  cooperative-thread-pool size, and the H.264/HEVC decoders all differ. Always
  reproduce and confirm on the **physical Apple TV**.
- The device is shared and is a hard lock: **one install at a time**. Compiling is
  free; installing replaces the app, so two deploys clobber each other. Only the
  agent who "holds" the device deploys.
- Device total RAM is ~4.16 GB but apps are jetsam-killed long before that. Treat
  **~1 GB resident as the danger zone**; sustained climbing memory = a leak/storm.

Device identifiers (this machine):
- `devicectl` ID (install/launch/copy files): `DE913871-CC2D-5F75-B4F2-0D6F44AA30DE`
- `xctrace`/Instruments UDID (different namespace!): `00008110-001C25343E61401E`

## 1. Build, deploy, launch

```bash
cd <worktree>
export GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS="'safe.bareRepository=all'"
tools/deploy-tv.sh --build-only
# Only when deployment is authorized:
tools/deploy-tv.sh
```

Notes:
- Device deployment wrappers use optimized Debug builds by default. Use
  `--unoptimized` explicitly for debugger work, not performance acceptance.
  Keep the configuration and optimization level in every comparison record:
  an unoptimized byte-by-byte metadata scan can starve the media producer even
  when the same source and features play smoothly with optimization enabled.
- Use `tools/generate-project.sh` when adding/removing files; never bare XcodeGen,
  which skips version baking. The deploy script generates a missing project.
- `swift build` does **not** work (AetherEngine's FFmpeg xcframeworks are
  tvOS-only). Build through Xcode for the tvOS destination.
- Always do a fresh device build immediately before install so you never ship a
  stale bundle.

---

## 2. On-device instrumentation (temporary, by design)

### Server-issued transcode stop or post-start playback freeze

An ffmpeg `[q] command received` proves a stop command reached the encoder, not
who requested it. Correlate the server request/session log with `PLZXHAND session`
events in the persistent playback journal. `REPORT_BEGIN/ACK/FAILED` bracket
playback reporting; `ENCODING_STOP_BEGIN/ACK/FAILED` bracket encoding deletion.
`STOP_INTENT`, `RELEASE_INTENT`, `RELEASE_JOIN`, and `RESTART` identify the local
owner/call path, including orphaned prefetch and rendition replacement. A
`resume-convergence-fallback` report is the older-Jellyfin session-less resume
write, not a user stop. Emby resume writes use the documented
[`POST /Users/{UserId}/Items/{ItemId}/UserData`](https://dev.emby.media/reference/RestAPI/PlaystateService/postUsersByUseridItemsByItemidUserdata.html);
the Jellyfin `/UserItems/{ItemId}/UserData` route is not interchangeable.
`RESUME_WRITE_BEGIN/ACK/FAILED` records that operation. Emby failures, including
404, propagate to the durable watch outbox for retry instead of issuing
`/Sessions/Playing/Stopped`.

The ordinary checkpoint interval is 60 seconds after the start report; app
backgrounding can also request a checkpoint. The reconciler defers the exact
live `(accountID, itemID)`, not all writes to that server. Older queued writes
and writes for another item therefore need a truly session-less provider API.
This is a contract hazard, not proof that a particular observed encoder quit
came from a checkpoint.

Server, device, item and play-session correlation fields are the first eight
bytes of SHA-256 in hexadecimal; match them to server-side IDs without copying
credentials or authenticated URLs into diagnostics. Native `LIFECYCLE` events
retain item-status, time-control, stall and error evidence after `readyToPlay`.
These observers only collect evidence; they never stop or retry playback.
Absence of the older `streaming RELEASE_ACK` message alone cannot rule out a
playback-stop report. Server logs are still needed to establish the origin of
an encoder stop and whether a session-scoped request affected another session.

### Temporary measurement scaffolding

While chasing a perf bug it is worth adding a **temporary** file-logger that
writes to the app container so you can pull it over USB/Wi-Fi with `devicectl`.
Any such scaffold **must be stripped before merging to `main`** — it is a
diagnostic aid, not a feature. Keep only the real fixes it helped you find.

What such a logger should provide:
- Timestamped event marks (e.g. `LOAD exit`, `ENRICH start`).
- A crash/signal handler so a jetsam/crash leaves a trail.
- A watchdog + vitals sampler (see below) — the heavy hitter.

### Keep physical UI automation out of the measurement

`xcodebuild -collect-test-diagnostics never` does **not** disable XCTest's
automatic screen recording. The physical Home rows scheme uses
`captureScreenshotsAutomatically: false` and
`preferredScreenCaptureFormat: screenshots`; its driver verifies generated
`SystemAttachmentLifetime=keepNever` and `PreferredScreenCaptureFormat=screenshots`
before running. Leave ordinary UI-test evidence settings unchanged.

Attach to the existing app rather than reinstalling or terminating it. Verify
the same process ID before and after runner setup, which may temporarily
foreground the system launcher. Restore that existing app after runner teardown.
Require actual focused media cards before directional input; repeated library
headings alone do not identify a unique row.

Bracket accessibility snapshots separately from input. Remote-call duration
includes XCTest overhead: a three-second hold can take roughly eight seconds
to return. The idle tail must not be presented as sustained paging performance.
Passing focus assertions proves navigation coverage, not smooth frame pacing.

The opt-in `PlozzPhysicalHomeRowsTests` scheme builds only an unbound remote
runner. It must not install or restart the app under measurement:

```sh
export PLOZZ_HOME_DEVICE_ID='<physical Apple TV UDID>'
bash tools/run-physical-home-rows-first.sh --build-runner
PLOZZ_HOME_ROWS_FIRST="$PLOZZ_HOME_DEVICE_ID" \
PLOZZ_HOME_RELEASE_APP_INSTALLED=1 \
PLOZZ_HOME_START_ROW='Continue Watching' \
PLOZZ_HOME_REPEATS=3 \
bash tools/run-physical-home-rows-first.sh --run-horizontal-only
```

Confirm the current Release app process and populated Home content, then post the
unique `warm-ready` notification printed by the runner within 30 seconds. Each repeat
prints its own notification; do not relaunch or reactivate between repeats.
`--run-vertical-only` checks two vertical moves in each direction across available
neighboring rows. `--run-hero-off` combines horizontal and vertical work. The
runner never changes the hero setting; use these hero-off workloads only when
the hero is already disabled.
Omit `PLOZZ_HOME_START_ROW` to measure the current populated row. Section titles
must match the app's effective language.

`--run-vertical-roundtrip` follows the observed Home layout with the hero either
enabled or disabled. It visits up to sixteen identified media rows, then returns
through those rows to the starting position. Set `PLOZZ_HOME_REQUIRE_HERO=1` and
`PLOZZ_HOME_CW_PAGING=1` for the primary Hero, Continue Watching paging, lower-row,
and return tour. Repeated headings are disambiguated using adjacent rows and card
identities, not the heading alone. `--observe-home` captures accessibility evidence
without sending directional input. These modes prove functional coverage only.

`--run-pinned-navigation` exercises the existing Movies library without selecting
another destination or changing settings. `PLOZZ_PINNED_LIBRARY_LABEL` overrides
the expected selected library's localized title. Confirm the current process on
Recommended with the pinned sidebar closed and a header control focused before
posting `warm-ready`. Up to three observed preparatory Left presses position focus
on Recommended. Six Left/Right pairs then verify the selected library row on every
open and Recommended on every close, with the content mode unchanged. Failure
stops input and preserves the final hierarchy, screenshot, and input timeline;
there is no relaunch or recovery navigation. Checking only a burst's final state
can mistake movement between Recommended and Browse for sidebar roundtrips.
This checked workload is not rapid-reversal, cold-first-open, or hitch-free evidence.

For a cold **Hero → Continue Watching** case, start the unbound runner before
the externally controlled app launch and retain the new PID and launch timestamp.
Use `PLOZZ_HOME_FIRST_DOWN_ONLY=1` with `--run-vertical-roundtrip` and one
repetition. This requires the hero to already hold focus, disables sidebar
recovery, and sends no preparatory navigation. `PLOZZ_HOME_HERO_WARM_PAIRS=1..6`
can follow that first Down with explicitly warm Hero/CW pairs; those repetitions
are not cold evidence. An asleep-device launch rejection is a blocked run, not
an app crash, and must not trigger an unapproved wake or a replacement launch.

Direct calls to `XCTMetric`'s lifecycle callbacks do not replace XCTest's
measurement setup. On Xcode 27, a built-in hitch metric asserted `_startDate`
when asked to report a manually collected interval. That experiment was removed;
the old `PLOZZ_HOME_HERO_ONE_SHOT` flag now fails before starting a runner.
Use external profiling for the first cold transition, not discarded warm-up
samples or empty direct-callback results.

Artifacts include the original app log, test result, actual focus/input timeline,
and, when diagnostics are available, `frame-window-summary.json`. Callback-only
hero-off workloads require contemporaneous diagnostic samples; native hitch
measurements remain valid without them and explicitly record their absence.
An unavailable row, changed app process, or disconnected test runner is incomplete
coverage, not a passing performance result. Installing a different build during
a run invalidates the comparison.

### Presented-frame hitch measurements

On tvOS 26 or newer, the physical runner can collect `XCTHitchMetric(application:)`:
`--measure-right` / `--measure-left` measure a three-second directional hold;
`--measure-down` / `--measure-up` measure one transition to an already observed,
unambiguous neighboring row. Each workload returns three samples after XCTest's
warm-up iteration. Manual measurement boundaries exclude accessibility snapshots
and the reverse input used to reset the starting position.

Use `PLOZZ_HOME_ALLOW_HERO=1` for row measurements while leaving the hero enabled.
`PLOZZ_HOME_START_ROW` preparation follows verified adjacent rows outside the
measurement. `--measure-hero-down` / `--measure-hero-up` measure the transition
between the actual hero and Continue Watching. Neither the retained samples nor
a warm functional tour prove immediate-startup performance: record the first
input's time relative to a separately verified new app process and distinguish
that first traversal from the warmed repetitions.

`--measure-vertical-burst` is a different, **warm media-row** workload. It
pre-verifies adjacent rows, then sends six Down/Up pairs per measurement without
accessibility checks between presses. Log the actual cadence and verify the
ending destination. A Continue Watching/Watchlist or Watchlist/Recently Added
burst is not a substitute for the cold Hero/Continue Watching case.

`--measure-multirow-up` first verifies four populated rows below Continue Watching
and their return path. Each sample then measures four consecutive Up presses from
the deepest verified row, followed by 0.6 seconds for the final arrival to settle.
Downward preparation and accessibility checks are outside the measurement.
This exercises accumulated upward motion into the shorter row, unlike alternating
between the top two rows. Actual remote-call timestamps remain authoritative;
XCTest's press cadence is not the same as a fast physical remote gesture.

The driver exports `native-metrics.json` from the result bundle and requires
finite native hitch measurements, not just successful focus assertions. Keep the
reported duration, count, and time-ratio units. A passing XCTest run means the
measurements were collected; it does not establish acceptable performance.
Display-link callback gaps are a separate diagnostic, not presented-frame hitches.

`PLOZZ_HOME_METRIC_IDLE_CONTROL=1` with a horizontal metric mode measures three
seconds of idle time, then performs the directional input after measurement stops.
This checks that input/reset overhead is not leaking into the measured interval.
One physical control returned hitch counts `[0, 0, 1]`, versus more than twenty
per sample during the actual paging workload. Do not compare that idle control
with a scrolling result as if it were an optimization.

The isolated `PlozzFocusHost` supports `--production-home-fixture`,
`--hero-disabled-home`, and `--home-performance-fixture` (long rows).
Optional `--pinned-home`, `--distinct-home-artwork`, `--complex-home-artwork`,
and `--home-menu-control` add one workload dimension at a time without touching
the real app's accounts or settings. Select it explicitly with
`PLOZZ_HOME_APP_BUNDLE_ID=com.thatcube.Plozz.FocusHost`; the default remains Plozz.
Synthetic assets and a small number of rows are not a substitute for real Home.

For gradient-background comparisons, `ShowcaseNavigationTests` accepts
`TEST_RUNNER_PLOZZ_GRADIENT_COMPARISON=1` and
`TEST_RUNNER_PLOZZ_GRADIENT_DISABLED=1` (baseline) or `0` (enabled).
Run horizontal and vertical Showcase workloads plus
`testCarouselHeroGradientNavigationHitches`: the latter verifies actual classic
hero slide changes, not just movement among its action buttons. The fixture uses
distinct, coloured cached artwork per title. Both arms keep the same Black theme,
data and input sequence. Retain native metric arrays and authoritative results;
a testmanagerd disconnect is incomplete even when it prints partial metrics.
These compare rendering, palette work and native navigation, not real-server
latency or the user's artwork variety. Verify both layouts with real libraries
before treating fixture results as end-to-end performance acceptance.

**Calibrate a new metric target before trusting zero hitches.** The fixture's
`--home-hitch-positive-control` injects bounded 120 ms main-thread stalls. Run
that case with `PLOZZ_HOME_EXPECT_HITCHES=1` so the driver rejects all-zero results.
On the tested Xcode 27/tvOS 27 setup, hitch collection returned zero despite
confirmed stalls when the executable was named `PlozzFocusHost` but the bundle
suffix was `FocusHost`. The target now uses executable `FocusHost`, with the
hosted-test loader path updated to match. The positive control then detected
the stalls. Results from the earlier mismatched target are invalid.

`--sweep-down` / `--sweep-up` visit up to four populated rows per repetition,
paging both ways and checking each vertical transition. Up to three repetitions
continue from the reached position without relaunching. Use
`PLOZZ_HOME_SWEEP_STOP_ROW` for an explicit endpoint; identical library headings
are distinguished by their actual cards. Record partial coverage when a later
row is unavailable, even if all preceding rows passed.

A native horizontal collection experiment reduced a same-build Continue Watching
comparison's mean hitch-time ratio from 36.062 to 23.778 ms/s, but still showed
hitches. A later physical startup exposed reentrant collection-cell recycling
during a focus update. The experiment and its focus bridge were removed; a
performance improvement does not excuse a failed lifecycle gate. An additional
observable-hosting-state experiment also failed to improve the measurements and
was removed.

### Opt-in Home cache and native artwork timings

For the Home stall investigation, launch the actual **Release** app with both
`PLZIO=1` and `PLZXMEM=1` (with `devicectl`, pass
`DEVICECTL_CHILD_PLZIO=1 DEVICECTL_CHILD_PLZXMEM=1`). No debugger, overlay, or
view-tree change is required. These flags are read once; enabling them requires
an authorized relaunch. Records join the existing per-launch
`Library/Caches/plzxmem.log` as `PLZXMEM PLZIO ...`. `PLZPERF_STDOUT=1` can be
enabled alongside them for the existing Home frame/main-hop measurements.

Labels:

- `identity.model.load`, `identity.model.save`: the store executor's synchronous
  work at restore and after the warm wave. Save excludes the awaited index export.
  `items` counts persisted membership entries, not unique titles.
- `identity.store.load`, `identity.store.save`: entire file-store calls,
  including lock acquisition. `identity.store.read`, `identity.store.decode`,
  `identity.store.encode`, `identity.store.write`: individual file/JSON phases.
- `home.model.load`: constructor's content-store load.
  `home.store.load`: full load, including memo lookup; a memoized result has no
  nested `home.store.read` / `home.store.decode` record.
- `native.poster.prepare`, `native.poster.update`, `native.poster.layout`:
  synchronous native poster preparation, SwiftUI-to-UIKit updates, and UIKit
  layout. These hot-path spans emit only at or above 1 ms.
- `cloud.ledger.load`, `cloud.ledger.encode`, `cloud.ledger.write`: local
  CloudKit-channel persistence. `cloud.ledger.unchanged` records an avoided
  write; no record values or identities are logged.
- `home.model.saveHero`: the persistence executor's synchronous curated-hero save.
  `home.hero.save`: full store call. Both report input item counts.
  `home.hero.sanitize`: bounded credential sanitization and stored-value
  construction, reporting retained items.
  `home.hero.encode`, `home.hero.mkdir`, `home.hero.write`: JSON encoding,
  directory creation, and atomic write. Read/encode/write phases report bytes;
  the hero write also reports retained items.

Each record carries start epoch seconds (`startUnix`), monotonic start
milliseconds (`startUptimeMs`), elapsed `ms`, and `main=1` if the synchronous
operation ran on the main thread. `success=0` means the measured closure threw;
`success=1` means it returned, **not** that a wrapper which swallows errors
persisted successfully. Consult the nested read/decode/write records.
Unknown/unreported counts use `-1`. No titles, identifiers, paths, URLs, tokens,
or error descriptions are emitted.

The timing helper itself never changes execution or return/error behavior.
Disabled instrumentation skips clocks,
counts, formatting, and queue creation. Enabled output formats and writes only
on a utility queue, bounded to 64 pending records; a full queue drops new
records rather than blocking for the sink. `dropped` reports cumulative drops
before that record was admitted. Output can lag the measured work, so correlate
using recorded start/duration, not line order. Parent/child intervals overlap;
do not add them together. Timings identify work to investigate, not proof that
I/O caused a particular frame gap or that an accessibility query was harmless.

#### Native bitmap and caption work

Continue Watching retains the original SwiftUI reflection/crop rendering.
`ExtendedArtworkBitmap` reuses its renderer and caches completed bitmaps by
source-image identity, target size, and scale. The evictable cache has targets
of 32 entries and 24 MB; weak source references avoid pinning decoded artwork,
and an identity check rejects recycled object identifiers. Recreated lazy cards
can reuse completed pixels instead of rendering the reflection again.

Focus-only caption movement changes transforms and colors, not intrinsic row
geometry. Native focus presentation and artwork clipping are separate:
`TVCardView` still needs clips around artwork nested above captions, while
`TVPosterView` owns its image clipping. The hosted framed/landscape return
regression checks the actual painted artwork bounds.

Native poster controls receive their initial cached `UIImage` directly from
the existing ordered artwork resolver. The former zero-sized background loader
published through a second observable state after construction, so even warmed
cards first created placeholder artwork and then updated the native view.
The direct bitmap path keeps one native view identity across loading and loaded
states, using the same source ordering, provider policy, and progressive loading.

Continue Watching logo prefetch also deduplicates overlapping lookahead windows
within a traversal. Five neighboring cards appearing together previously
scheduled 45 logo-prefetch tasks for only 13 unique items. Changed logo references
still qualify, and reversing direction or leaving the row resets the history.
Textless-backdrop warmup remains independently responsible for its own identity
and retry rules.

These changes preserve layout and rendering behavior. Their combined real-Home
performance still requires repeated device measurements; successful builds or
functional focus checks are not a claim that all navigation hitches are gone.

#### Shared artwork load recovery

Home, library, and detail artwork share `ArtworkImageCache`. Its in-flight entries
must not live indefinitely: one stalled request can otherwise collect new callers
long after the original view disappeared. A shared load has one 30-second lifetime,
matching the artwork resource timeout; joining it does not extend that deadline.
Expiry retires the exact load, releases all waiting consumers, and cancels its
transfer and decode job so the existing fallback chain can continue. Cancelled
network-file loads leave the concurrency-limiter queue without waiting for an
occupied permit. Running operations retain their permits until they return;
expiration must not overbook uncooperative I/O.

A late completion or deadline cannot overwrite or retire a replacement request.
Cancelling one consumer preserves work needed by another; cancelling the last
consumer also retires the deadline. Credential invalidation still takes precedence.
Already-decoded, admitted pixels remain usable if optional disk persistence runs
past the deadline. Logical expiry does not prove that uncooperative underlying I/O
has drained, so transport limits and explicit resource shutdown remain necessary.
`ArtworkLoadRecoveryTests` exercises stalled remote and network-file loads with
controlled deadlines, including old-work completion after a successful replacement.
The hosted `NativeFocusRequestHostedTests` recovery case uses the production
deadline and fallback retry, asserting that the visible native poster receives
artwork without replacing its view or losing focus.

Network-file opens also report connection failures to
`MediaTransportResolverRegistry`. The failed connection generation stops accepting
new leases; the next normal request can reconnect while existing readers retain
their original session until their last lease drains. Releases and failure reports
are generation-bound, so old work cannot affect the replacement. The session owns
error classification: SMB distinguishes connection-loss NTSTATUS values from
missing-file and authentication failures. Credential/trust boundaries remain
unchanged, and the failed open still propagates its original error rather than
retrying inside the resolver. `ResolverFailureRetirementTests` and
`SMBMediaTransportTests` cover those ownership and failure-classification rules.

These regressions establish recovery behavior, not the cause of an unrecorded
on-device incident.

#### Hero freshness without navigation churn

The visible carousel and its cached candidate pool have separate limits. The
carousel still defaults to eight slides (configurable from one to twenty).
Featured and Random request up to 48 raw candidates; each discovery source keeps
`min(40, max(12, displayedCount * 2))` validated alternatives. Seerr trending
retrieval retains its five-request/100-candidate ceiling for legacy callers.
Production Featured instead blends the profile's enabled metadata discovery
feeds; Seerr is optional for requests and status. Watched, artwork, library visibility, and deduplication
rules still apply before a title can become a slide.

`HeroFreshnessSnapshot` ranks discovery candidates by never shown, then least
recently shown, with stable per-session tie-breaking. Continue Watching and
Recently Added keep their existing order. Watchlist keeps the viewer's list
order (new additions normally lead) unless Discovery rotation is enabled.
Cached alternatives retain their source provenance, allowing even a one-slide
hero to choose a different discovery title on the next cold launch. Legacy flat
snapshots retain their order until replaced by a fresh, source-aware pool.

A title counts as seen only after the current slide remains visible for two
seconds in the active app. Hidden tabs, covered pages, receded/offscreen heroes,
and in-progress slide transitions do not count. Exposure updates do not publish
observable Home state; bounded per-profile hashed identity history is written
off the main actor. Reading, fetching, validating, or caching a title never
records exposure.

The retained refresh clock requests a full curation after ten minutes while
Home is visible, or on a stale foreground/Home return. It is independent of the
content task key, so unchanged rows cannot suppress freshness indefinitely.
Fresh data is merged without displacing the current slide or restarting its
trailer; failed refreshes retain the usable cache. Explicit library/source
eligibility changes override that protection and invalidate stale selections,
including memoized startup choices. Explicit Watchlist membership removal must
also retire a pin when no other enabled source still supplies that title;
ordinary discovery rotation must not. Featured status polling
refreshes the displayed titles directly, including titles outside trending's
first page. These policies are shared by tvOS and iOS.

#### Broader Featured discovery

`HeroDiscoveryRuntime` binds public feed candidates to the active profile's
library copies only after bounded live identity and eligibility checks.
Cached index hints must not upgrade rejected discovery records back to Play
through metadata enrichment, CTA classification, or playback selection.
Discovery-tagged records use only their verified source set; explicit library
disablement also prunes cached ownership. A failed provider lookup preserves an
external title, not an invented playable copy.
Lightweight watch-state refreshes must preserve this boundary too: they read
only carried, verified copies and accept live watch fields only from matching
identities. They must not widen routing through index hints.

iOS curation keys include the scoped identity-index publication revision when
Featured discovery is enabled. An index warming after cold discovery therefore
triggers live ownership verification without waiting for the ten-minute timer.
Source-label and other presentation-only settings do not trigger that work.
The selected slide's root/episode resolution and caches also key on ownership,
routing and scope rather than display id alone. A pinned catalog series can gain
Play without paging away, and revoked routes cannot reuse its cached episode.
Provider hydration must still match the verified physical parent before querying
children. Resolved episodes retain discovery provenance and only the actual
resolved provider route, never alternate episode routes inferred from series refs.

Optional Seerr availability runs independently of initial hero publication.
Status task keys change when published request identities or profile/connection
scope changes, not when status/progress values change. A batch returns completed
statuses within five seconds; the shared four-operation limit includes cancelled
or retired HTTP work until it actually returns. Deadline, cancellation, and
connection rotation stop admitting more candidates.

`HeroDiscoveryService` caches only public, unowned provider results, separately
from profile watch state and hero exposure. It coalesces identical requests,
returns completed sources within a 15-second response budget, and retires a
shared producer after 20 seconds without renewing its lifetime for new callers.
The admission count includes retired producers until they actually return.
Transient errors and rate limits retain cached data with bounded backoff; a
failure must not be presented as an authoritative empty catalog.

Provider selection is part of `HeroConfigurationKey`. In particular, switching
from one feed to another must not allow a failed refresh to relabel and persist
the previous feed's candidates under the new selection. Attribution source
names and per-item URLs remain separate from playable server identity.
Featured's two-year release policy is also versioned in that key, retiring
older all-time catalog seeds and candidate pools without deleting exposure
history or unrelated Home caches. Current-airing evidence can admit older
series without changing their original premiere dates. Feed caches distinguish
release-window policies. Hero source labels are optional and default off;
Simkl is opt-in and always carries its required visible credit when used.
See `Sources/MetadataKit/README.md` for the individual feed and attribution rules.

#### Library-channel identifier validation during Home paging

A physical Time Profiler capture of six seconds of requested Continue Watching
holds attributed 2,393 ms of background CPU to `CharacterSet.contains` within
library-channel snapshot validation. A byte-wise ASCII fast path now retains the
same 512-byte limit, account-only pipe allowance, and original Unicode
`CharacterSet` fallback. Validation is not skipped, and persisted formats and
accepted identifiers do not change.

The follow-up capture attributed 10 ms to `CharacterSet.contains`, with total
item-validation CPU falling from 3,434 to 558 ms. These are sampled CPU totals,
not wall-clock startup timings. Main-thread rendering remained expensive and
paging still hitched; reducing background work alone did not resolve the UI
bottleneck.

The portable Live TV record validator has a separate identifier policy: reject
URL schemes, query markers, and newlines, without imposing the library recipe's
character allowlist. Its ASCII path scans bytes for those exact patterns; every
non-ASCII value still uses the original substring checks. Keep those policies
distinct. Parity coverage includes every ASCII byte, overlapping scheme prefixes,
Unicode combining marks, and the 512-byte boundary.

#### Measured persistence follow-up and completion barriers

The Release capture identified main-thread identity load (180.2 ms, including
164.5 ms JSON decode), Home content load (59.3 ms), and hero save (113.8 ms,
including 110.1 ms atomic write). These exceed a frame budget; they do not
explain the entire multi-second navigation gap.

Identity load/save now run on `IdentityIndexPersistence`, with lazy file-store
construction there too. Replacement warm waves share a pending restore; reset
cancels/discards that task. Applying a restore, publishing, verification flags,
and saving recheck cancellation, generation, and the captured profile namespace.
An ordered per-namespace writer rejects stale save generations. No file-store
lock is acquired on the main actor.

Hero saves and clears now use `HomeSnapshotPersistence`, sharing its serial
executor but tracking independent row/hero generations by persistence scope.
Whole-Home clears advance both streams; `HomeContentStoring.clearRows()` lets
an older row clear retain a newer hero. A queued clear invalidates the current
model's cached hero immediately. Accepted durable requests survive model
teardown without retaining it. Hero memo publication is revision-fenced against
concurrent writes; expired hero reads become misses without deleting a file
that a newer atomic write may have replaced. The tvOS root now prepares the Home store on `HomeContentPrewarmer` before
bootstrap exposes Home. Store construction, schema maintenance, and the first
JSON decode run on that actor; the existing synchronous model initializer then
reads the prepared memo and preserves its cached first paint. The root rechecks
cancellation and the active profile namespace before bootstrap. iOS retains its
existing startup path.

Row memo publication also checks a per-file revision. A decode superseded by a
save or clear cannot return or memoize its old content. Expired reads are cache
misses and do not unlink a file that a writer may have just replaced.

For an in-process test, await `HomeViewModel.waitForHeroPersistence()` after
curation/save/clear, or `IdentityIndexModel.waitForIdentityWarm()` after starting
a warm wave. The latter includes provider scans and can take much longer than
the I/O itself. Both follow replacement requests made while waiting. They wait
for attempts, not guaranteed durable success: the stores retain their existing
best-effort error semantics. Verify the loaded file/content or successful
`home.hero.write` / `identity.store.write` record before claiming persistence.
With `PLZIO=1 PLZXMEM=1`, moved work should report `main=0`. The synchronous
`home.model.load` memo lookup still reports `main=1`, but tvOS startup should no
longer decode the snapshot there. Output is asynchronous, so
completion barriers do not also flush the diagnostic output queue.

#### Background sync and catalog work during paging

A physical Time Profiler capture showed substantial JSON encoding in
`CloudConfigSyncService.persist` while Home was idle. Each channel now checkpoints
only successful writes; unchanged durable ledger fields skip encoding and disk
I/O. Real changes, clock changes, acknowledgements, tombstones, and primary-channel
engine-state changes still persist synchronously on the service actor. Failed
writes do not advance the checkpoint and remain eligible for retry. File formats,
merge rules, and authorization gates are unchanged.

The actor initializer previously decoded the persisted channels on its caller,
including a measured roughly one-second main-thread decode. Restoration now runs
once on the actor before engine creation or operations that need the ledger.
Physical follow-up confirmed all channel loads off-main. This removes startup
blocking; it does not establish flawless navigation.

An actual six-second paging capture also attributed substantial background CPU
to artwork association queries. The previous `substr(rel_path, ...)` predicate
materialized few rows but still **scanned** unrelated assets. A binary path range
and an index on `metadata_root` let both branches use indexes. The regression
fixture verifies identical literal/case/Unicode matching, zero full-scan steps
with 10,000 unrelated assets, and over 100-fold fewer SQLite VM steps. This is
query-work reduction, not a claimed 100-fold improvement in frame rate.

Native poster captions must not invalidate intrinsic size when focus changes
only their transform and color. Their geometry remains constant; font, subtitle
visibility, and configured focus clearance still invalidate layout when needed.
Hosted coverage checks zero intrinsic invalidations across repeated focus flips,
while retaining the existing focus-reversal and sizing checks.

### The watchdog + vitals are the single most useful tool

A classic main-thread "is it hung?" timer is useless here because the thing you
are measuring (a saturated cooperative pool or a pegged CPU) also starves the
timer. So the watchdog runs on a **dedicated high-priority OS `Thread`** that
cannot be starved:

- A `userInteractive` `Thread` ticks every 500 ms; a main-runloop `Timer` bumps a
  liveness counter every 200 ms. If the main counter stalls, the dedicated thread
  logs `🛑 MAIN BLOCKED <ms>` / `✅ MAIN RESUMED`.
- Every ~2 s it logs mach-based vitals: `📊 mem=<MB> threads=<n> cpu=<%>` using
  `TASK_VM_INFO.phys_footprint` (true footprint), `task_threads` (live thread
  count), and per-thread `thread_basic_info` summed (CPU %, where 100% = one core).

This is what turns "the app feels slow" into a number. A healthy idle page reads
~130 MB / ~110% CPU / ~12 threads. The freeze read **1710 MB / ~300% CPU**.

### Pull the log

```bash
xcrun devicectl device copy from --device DE913871-CC2D-5F75-B4F2-0D6F44AA30DE \
  --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier com.thatcube.Plozz --user mobile \
  --source Library/Caches/plzdetail.log --destination /tmp/plz.log
```

Then quantify:
```bash
grep -c "MAIN BLOCKED" /tmp/plz.log                       # how many stalls
grep -oE "mem=[0-9]+MB" /tmp/plz.log | grep -oE "[0-9]+" | sort -n | tail   # peak memory
grep -oE "cpu=[0-9]+%"  /tmp/plz.log | grep -oE "[0-9]+" | sort -n | tail   # peak CPU
```

### The Instances row (live object counts — catches churn / leaks without a trace)

The Playback Diagnostics overlay (toggled by the **Playback Diagnostics** setting;
`PlaybackDiagnosticsOverlay` + `PlaybackDiagnosticsSampler`, model in
`CoreModels/PlaybackDiagnostics.swift`) has an **Instances** row reading
`Players <x> · AVPlayer <y>` — "Instances" because these are **live
object counts** (how many exist right now, not a cumulative total). The counters
are incremented in `init` / decremented in `deinit` of `PlayerViewModel`
(shown as `Players`) and `NativeVideoEngine` (shown as `AVPlayer`) — see
`CoreModels/PlaybackInstrumentation.swift`; the Memory row is backed by
`TASK_VM_INFO.phys_footprint`. They only reset on a full app relaunch.

Read it like this — it names a whole class of bug in seconds, no trace needed:
- **Outside the player it should read `Players 0 · AVPlayer 0`.** During
  playback, one player session + the native AVPlayer the engine drives — e.g.
  `Players 1 · AVPlayer 1` for an AVPlayer direct-play or a Plozzigen session
  (Plozzigen feeds a local AVPlayer, so it also shows on the AVPlayer count).
- **Counts climb and never fall** as you leave/re-enter the player → a true
  **leak** (a retain cycle). **Go straight to Xcode's Memory Graph Debugger —
  it names the retainer in one click. Do not start by reading code, and do not
  start with `xctrace`:** the Allocations/Leaks *detail* tables are not
  exportable from the command line, so a CLI trace cannot tell you WHO retains
  the object (it only confirms the leak you already know about). See
  §10 for the procedure and the SwiftUI bug class it catches.
- **Counts climb, then "correct down," then climb again** → **reachable
  throwaways**, not a leak: something is *constructing* these objects faster than
  ARC reaps them. This is almost always objects built **in a SwiftUI view body**
  (see the §5 trap and the §9 case study).
- **`AVPlayer` climbing far ahead of `Players`** is a specific tell: every
  `PlayerViewModel.init` builds a `NativeVideoEngine`, so a view-model-construction
  storm shows the AVPlayer count racing ahead of Players. (This single
  observation cracked the §9 bug.)

Like the file-logger, the overlay is a diagnostic aid — keep it gated behind the
setting; don't let it churn SwiftUI layout in the hot path.

## 3. Instruments without the GUI (`xctrace`)

A Time Profiler trace tells you *which threads burn CPU and in which binary* — and
on this app that immediately fingers the subsystem. The physical Apple TV is
visible to Instruments under the **xctrace UDID** (not the devicectl id).

For CPU attribution, disable **Record Waiting Threads** and verify the exported
recording metadata (`record-waiting-threads="0"`). Waiting-thread stacks can locate
blocked work, but their weights are not CPU usage or measured wait durations.
Resolve raw addresses only against image mappings for that exact process and a
UUID-matched executable/dSYM. Keep the app's hangs separate from test-runner hangs,
and correlate accessibility snapshots before attributing a hang to remote input.
An existing-app capture with no verified input is not a cold-open benchmark.

Use the coordinated recorder for a live reproduction:
```bash
tools/trace-device.sh --device "$DEVICE_ID" --time-limit 90s
# tvOS only: verify the named button already has focus, then press Select ONCE.
tools/trace-device.sh --device "$DEVICE_ID" --time-limit 120s --press-focused Movies
```
The device is explicit (CoreDevice ID, hardware ID, or name); the helper resolves
its hardware ID and takes a per-device lock shared across worktrees. It verifies
the installed app and live PID, never launches/replaces Plozz, and never resets
developer services. `--press-focused` builds/installs only the unbound XCTest
runner, rejects app-bound runner metadata, and rechecks the exact focused label
before input. It does not navigate to the control for you.

**Do not tell someone to reproduce while the recorder is merely starting.**
Current local Debug builds show a non-focusable status badge on tvOS and iOS:
preparing (wait), **Recording** with a red dot (ready), and finished/failed. The helper requires
the app's visible-status acknowledgement, the recorder's Darwin start
notification, and five seconds without an early disconnect before authorizing
input. Heartbeats maintain the badge; a missing heartbeat expires it after
15 seconds, including a render-server fade if the main thread is blocked.
Debug builds also export `Library/Caches/Plozz/diagnostic-images-{preparing,finished,failed}.json`
on those status transitions, not recording heartbeats. Each snapshot includes the
PID, build, image UUIDs and executable-segment load/file addresses; names contain
only binary basenames. dyld callbacks safely copy loaded-image metadata, and file
writes run on a utility queue. Copy these files alongside a raw trace when
Instruments loses image mappings. Match the PID/build and exact dSYM UUID before
resolving addresses; never reuse another process's ASLR mappings. Unmapped images
and export failures are reported explicitly.
Release builds have no receiver. `--no-indicator` is an explicit opt-out for
an older/release build, not an automatic fallback when an acknowledgement fails.

The bounded `playback-trace.log` journal also records `LIVE_TV` cold-load stages:
library discovery, snapshot hydration, schedule construction, and guide-loading
visibility. `libraryRestoreReady` precedes the automatic lineup refresh; a long
`libraryRefreshEnd` does not by itself mean the guide was still loading.
`NAVIGATION` records native top-tab selection requests and actual screen changes,
using only built-in destination names, so a later tab snap-back can be checked
without another launch or an Instruments recording.

The default uses `Blank` + the `Time Profiler` instrument, device-wide, then
counts samples only for the verified app PID. Both bundled and CPU-only
recordings can fail intermittently on current device/toolchain combinations:
the helper makes at most three **pre-input** attempts. It never repeats an
input after a disconnect. An explicit `--template` keeps that template and
attaches to the app instead. Non-CPU templates retain their trace but return
an explicit unverified result; their relevant tables require separate inspection.

Evidence stays under `.build/device-traces/<unique-run>/`: command logs,
original trace, remote screenshots/result bundle when requested, raw CPU XML,
and `report.json`. CPU captures require a readable timeline covering the requested
duration and actual samples for the verified PID; a zero exit code with
“Device disconnected” is not success. Raw samples are explicitly reported as
unsymbolicated. App inactivity near the end is not by itself a dropped recording.

Finalization gets up to ten minutes, separately from the requested recording
duration. Never kill a saving recorder after an arbitrary short wait. If its
document is incomplete but `Trace*.run/Attachments/trace-data.atrc` survives,
the helper uses native `xctrace import` into a **new** recovered trace and
preserves the original. A failed symbolicated export can be bypassed with the
`time-sample` raw CPU table; do not silently label raw addresses as resolved
symbols. Missing device support symbols also limit attribution in Debug builds.

Other useful templates: `Allocations` (attributes a memory total to a call stack —
the natural follow-up when memory is the problem), `Leaks`, `Swift Concurrency`.

Export and analyse the samples as XML (no GUI needed):
```bash
# 1) list tables
xcrun xctrace export --input /tmp/plz.trace --toc
# 2) dump the CPU samples (schema "time-profile"); "potential-hangs" lists main-thread hangs
xcrun xctrace export --input /tmp/plz.trace \
  --xpath '/trace-toc/run[@number="1"]/data/table[@schema="time-profile"]' > /tmp/samples.xml
```

Then aggregate. The decisive move is **CPU by thread name** and **CPU by leaf
binary** (see `scripts`/the case study below for a ~30-line Python aggregator).
Key reading tips:
- Each `<row>` is one ~1 ms sample with a `<weight>` and a `<tagged-backtrace>`; the
  **first** `<frame>` is the innermost (leaf) — where the CPU actually was.
- Frames can remain **unsymbolicated** (`name` == address), including in Debug
  when matching device-support/shared-cache symbols are missing. Thread names
  still help; leaf-binary attribution is usable only when image mappings exist.
  With matching app and platform symbols, an attached Debug trace can provide
  Swift symbol names like `NowPlayingView.body.getter`,
  `MusicCard.body.getter`, `SDFLayer.updateSDFEffects`, and the
  `Attribute.init<A>` closures. For a SwiftUI re-render storm those symbol names
  *are* the decisive signal — aggregate by symbol, not just by binary (see §7).
- Leaf binary `UNKNOWN` with no named binary often means **JIT code in anonymous
  memory** (i.e. JavaScriptCore executing). Treat a large UNKNOWN bucket as a clue,
  not noise — correlate it with JSC threads.
- **Preserve the live app.** Name and PID attachment can both fail even while
  CoreDevice reports the process running. The helper correlates the executable
  with the exact installed bundle URL, then defaults to device-wide CPU sampling
  filtered by that PID. Never relaunch an app merely to get past an attachment
  failure when that would destroy the reproduction state.

## 4. Decision tree

1. **Reproduce on device.** Note the exact gesture (here: open detail → back →
   scroll → open, repeated rapidly = "navigation churn").
2. **Watchdog vitals first.** Is it memory (climbing/peak), CPU (pegged), or a main
   stall (`MAIN BLOCKED`)?
   - Climbing memory → leak/storm → record **Allocations**.
   - Pegged CPU, modest memory → record **Time Profiler**, aggregate by thread.
   - `MAIN BLOCKED` but CPU idle → main actor is `await`-blocked → look for a
     synchronous wait / a `Task {}` that inherited `@MainActor`.
   - **Main thread busy but memory flat, no single heavy binary, and the hot
     symbols are `AG::Graph::*` / `Attribute.init` / `*.body.getter` /
     `SDFLayer` / `GlassContainer`** → **SwiftUI re-render storm**, not a resource
     storm. Jump to §7.
   - **In the player? Read the Instances row (§2) too.** Engine/player-session
     counts climbing (especially `AVPlayer` ≫ `Players`), whether monotonically
     (leak) or "climb → correct down → climb" (reachable throwaways built in a view
     body), names an object-churn bug directly. Jump to §9.
3. **Aggregate the trace by thread, then by leaf binary.** Name the subsystem.
4. **Find the trigger in code**, not just the symbol. Ask: *what user action
   speculatively starts this work, and is it cancelled when the user leaves?*
5. **Fix at the source** (bound concurrency, gate speculative work behind a dwell,
   cancel on disappear) rather than bounding after the fact.
6. **Re-measure on device.** Confirm the vitals number moved (peak memory down,
   `MAIN BLOCKED` count down). A fix you can't see in the vitals isn't confirmed.
7. **Strip all instrumentation**, clean build, deploy, final commit.

## 5. Traps specific to this codebase

### Large share-folder lists: lazy rendering is not bounded native focus

The 1,551-folder WebDAV picker opened quickly after switching to `LazyVStack`,
but repeated Down presses still froze. On the Apple TV 4K (2nd generation),
eight measured presses in the live app produced seven hitches totaling 3.971 s
(502.8 ms/s). A deterministic fixture using the production view reproduced
seven hitches totaling 4.555 s (531.5 ms/s).

A correlated CPU trace attributed 11,305 of 13,336 main-thread samples during
navigation to native focus movement. Hot stacks included
`_UIFocusRegionEvaluator` occlusion evaluation and `_UIFocusMapSnapshot`, not
network folder enumeration. Removing the root per-folder `FocusState`, replacing
the fade mask, or reducing scroll-geometry state updates individually did not
resolve it; those experiments were reverted. SwiftUI `List` improved timing but
still hitched and initially clipped horizontal focus cards.

`ShareLocationList` instead recycles `UITableView` cells. Only realized native
cells participate in focus; `SettingsFocusRow` shares the exact appearance and
contrast behavior with `SettingsFocusButtonStyle`. Keep the hosting
configuration's inherited SwiftUI environment and zero minimum content size.
The cells reserve horizontal space for the card/shadow, and the existing
vertical fade mask extends horizontally rather than cutting off either side.
Recreating the list on path changes retires stale cells and preserves the
screen's explicit "Use This Folder" entry focus.

The same physical fixture with the completed change recorded zero hitches for
its eight measured presses, with exact item advancement, folder entry/return,
and rendered left/right overhang assertions passing. An earlier native-cell
run recorded 0.050 s total (7.3 ms/s). These are controlled fixture results, not
a guarantee for every server or input cadence. The full app's live-server
navigation remains a separate check after installation.

Use `ShareFolderNavigationTests` in `PlozzHomeFixtureTests` for the deterministic
comparison. XCTest performs an eight-press warmup before the measured eight
presses. Preserve actual input timestamps and metrics; command round-trip time
and a passing functional test are not substitutes for presented-frame timing.

### tvOS focus handoffs (Search/sidebar)

- **Measure the focus result, not the request.** Enable `PLZHFOCUS_STDOUT=1`;
  compare `UIFocusSystem.focusedItem`, its frame and `canBecomeFocused`, then the
  visible highlight. A successful build or `FocusState` assignment proves neither.
- **Request through the shared native owner.** Native Search and nested library
  hosts can retain focus after leaf-only requests. `NavigationRailFocusHost`
  temporarily prefers the exact target and requests the update from the owner
  containing both current and requested focus. Confirm the actual focused item.
  Opening navigation does not need to disable and re-enable the entire page;
  retain the disabled-content gate only while a different destination is pending.
  Keep rail interaction state inside that hosting boundary, not above it:
  opening must not replace the whole hosted root or forward a newly captured
  environment through the stationary page. Actual content and environment
  changes still update the host. The native owner's focus flag is updated
  independently from the rail's observed focus state.
- **Return to real Search content.** `SearchPageFocusObserver` checks ownership by
  the native Search controller, not screen coordinates alone: outgoing Home
  content can occupy the same rectangle. Keep the capsule gated until entry.
  Distinguish results-edge navigation from keyboard/cursor movement.
- **Selecting a destination is not presentation completion.** Pinned navigation
  retains its real focused row while `NavigationDestinationFocusHandoff` waits
  for the requested page's appearance and a rendered frame. Supply the identity
  the content actually depicts, not a requested identity that still shows old
  content. Older/cancelled callbacks must not release a newer request. Do not
  replace this with an immediate focus clear or a fixed loading delay.
- **Closing pinned navigation restores its source.** Capture the real focused item
  before opening navigation; retain it weakly and reject detached, hidden, disabled,
  or no-longer-visible targets. Veto spatial Right while navigation owns focus so
  the existing boundary observer requests restoration instead of choosing Browse
  or a nearby card. The shared
  `NavigationRailFocusHost` supplies the preferred target and requests the update:
  UIKit ignores requests from a leaf or nested library host that does not contain
  current focus. A removed source falls back to the page's entry preference;
  switching destinations clears the source and uses the presentation fence above.
  Query each native container once, including visible nested controller roots:
  window queries alone omitted the share library's real header. Exclude every
  candidate owned by the rail and centered in a rail label, not just one
  minimum-area match. A nested page's controls can overlap the expanded labels
  without belonging to the rail; compare native ownership before excluding them. Scrolled
  rows overlap Profile and can have identical areas; virtual items can also be
  recreated between queries. The physical failure explicitly requested a rail
  item as page content, then moved again when the rail became disabled. Cross the
  newly enabled page's render commit before resolving its content target.
- **New-page entry prefers useful content.** `navigationEntryFocus` declares
  content and fallback regions without changing ordinary directional navigation.
  Libraries prefer their cards; Music prefers Recently Played, then Playlists.
  Apply the preference to cards rather than scan banners or Now Playing header
  accessories. Idle/loading pages declare a pending region; region changes wake
  the active request after rendering, without polling or focusing a header first.
  Empty/error states clear pending and use the remaining visible controls.
  Cancellation removes the observer, and a valid captured source still wins
  when closing navigation on the same page.
  Native library cells also supply a weak exact focus item. If every visible
  content region has one, resolve the first eligible card without enumerating
  the window's unrelated focus containers. Revalidate attachment, visibility,
  clipping, enabled state, ownership and viewport each time; mixed native/virtual
  regions retain full discovery. This adds no preloading or idle observer.
  A hosted share-library comparison reduced this lookup from roughly 3.4 ms
  to 0.2 ms; that isolates lookup work, not physical-device page-load latency.
- **Nested hosts must observe enabled-state changes.** Forwarding
  `context.environment` alone did not subscribe `NativeLibraryFocusHost` to
  `isEnabled`. A library could keep disabled controls after a shell gate
  cleared. Explicitly observe and forward `isEnabled`; retain the regression
  that holds the gate disabled with unchanged content before re-enabling it.
- **Pinned expansion changes horizontal geometry only.** Both states use the
  expanded panel's physical vertical inset. Interpolating vertical padding moved
  every row by 36pt in the hosted reproduction. Reveal offscreen destinations with
  minimal scrolling, not an unconditional centered jump; already-visible rows
  must retain their vertical positions when an opening request repeats.
  Each pending native-focus generation owns its reveal; do not also scroll for
  the shell's opening token. Initial selection and destination-list changes
  still reveal the selected destination independently.
- **Do not copy a hosting tree's private accessibility environment.** A whole
  `environment(\.self, ...)` bridge can leave a visibly rendered page absent from
  the accessibility tree. Adding a containment accessibility modifier alone does
  not repair it. Use `copyHostedPresentation(from:)` and explicitly forward the
  host's required observable models and ambient media context. Cover profile
  context changes as well as enabled-state changes across nested hosts.
- **Test destination selection separately from roundtrips.** For the physical
  pinned-navigation workload, `PLOZZ_PINNED_ENTER_LIBRARY=1` explicitly starts on
  Home, opens navigation, and selects the requested matching library. Use
  `PLOZZ_PINNED_LIBRARY_LABEL` and zero-based `PLOZZ_PINNED_LIBRARY_INDEX` when
  providers have duplicate names. `PLOZZ_PINNED_ENTRY_SOURCE_LABEL` selects an
  already-open source instead of Home. Require automatic page presentation,
  navigation closure, and the expected header focus before six open/close pairs.
  Share pages use `PLOZZ_PINNED_CONTENT_CONTROL='Browse Files'`, not Recommended;
  exclude the disabled same-named rail button from that query.
- **Measure menu animation separately.** `PLOZZ_PINNED_MEASURE_OPEN=1` runs three
  native hitch/CPU measurements plus XCTest's warm-up. Only Left and a 600ms
  settling interval are measured; accessibility assertions and Right resets are
  outside each interval. Validate exported native metrics, not just successful
  focus. The controlled Movies investigation recorded one 16.7ms hitch per
  opening initially, then zero on the unchanged build and on two subsequent
  shared-owner runs. A final installed-build repeat returned `[0, 1, 1]`
  hitches, about 16.7ms each when present; intermittent hitches remain.
  Sampled main-thread work across four openings was 1.114s before and 1.224s
  after, with cloud publication also present in the latter.
  This does not establish an aggregate CPU improvement or eliminate first-use
  stutter; warm zero-hitch runs are not proof that app performance is flawless.
- **Native Sidebar needs its own content gate.** `NativeSidebarFocusDestination`
  excludes inactive and not-yet-presented tab content without replacing native
  chrome. Final focus alone is not sufficient evidence: check the whole handoff
  and keep incoming/outgoing diagnostic regions distinct when tabs share a host.
- **Avoid false diagnostics.** Unhosted package tests have no window scene/focus
  system; use them for policy/geometry, not end-to-end focus proof.
  **`UIFocusDebugger` is LLDB-only:** calling it from app code throws
  `NSInternalInconsistencyException` and crashes.
- **Short trials, not repeated user chores.** After one failed hypothesis, compare
  isolated, launch-selected candidates in one authorized build; automate the same
  handoff, record pass/fail, repeat the winner, then remove the trial driver.
  Confirm both opening and returning on hardware. Keep authorized `--console`
  captures alive: ending the launching process can terminate the app.

### Performance traps

- **Receipt lookup must also be cheap.** Partition portable Live TV record IDs
  once on the preparation actor and reuse their parsed profile ownership while
  those IDs remain in the input. Do not repeatedly decode and re-encode every ID
  for each profile on the main actor before taking the unchanged-capture path.
  Payload edits must still invalidate content fingerprints; only ID ownership is
  cached, and removed IDs must leave that cache.
- **Avoid per-movie representative queries during scan finalization.** Resolve
  all movie-group representatives in one grouped query, including members without
  explicit filename IDs. Retain ambiguity rejection and orphan cleanup. This
  reduces the cost of a required reconciliation; it does not make a resumed or
  changed scan an unchanged scan.
- **`Task {}` inside a `@MainActor` type inherits `@MainActor`.** Its body runs on
  the main actor. Use `Task.detached` (or hop to a background actor) for heavy work,
  or you'll measure main-actor saturation and blame the wrong thing.
- **`Task.sleep` deadlines are unreliable under pool saturation** — the continuation
  needs a cooperative-pool thread, which is exactly what's starved. For a deadline
  that always fires, use a libdispatch timer (`DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter`)
  or a `URLSession` resource timeout. (This bit the trailer cross-server search.)
- **Cancellation ≠ stopping in-flight synchronous work.** A `[weak self]` capture
  stops *retention*, not *execution*. A detached cache `Task` keeps running even
  after the caller is cancelled. Synchronous `JSContext.evaluateScript` can't be
  interrupted at all — so the only defense is to not *start* it (dwell gate) and to
  cap how many run at once.
- **Speculative work during browsing is the enemy.** Cross-server search fan-out,
  alternate-source discovery, and trailer extraction are all things done for a page
  the user may never settle on. Gate them behind a short cancellable **dwell** so a
  fast tap-through does nothing, and **bound** their concurrency so a slow server or
  a heavy extraction can't stack up.
- **Downsample artwork.** `ArtworkImageVariant` caps decode pixel size per use
  (poster 960, landscape 1200, hero 2000); only `.original` is full-res. A bulk
  decode of `.original` is a fast way to blow up memory — don't.
- **Never construct a view model (or anything heavy) inside a view-body / sheet /
  cover content closure.** SwiftUI re-invokes those closures on *every* render
  pass, and `@State`/`@StateObject` keep only the **first** value — so a
  `MyModel(...)` written inline in `.fullScreenCover { … } `/`.sheet { … }`/a
  `body` builds and **throws away** a fresh model on every render. For
  `PlayerViewModel` each throwaway also spins up a `NativeVideoEngine` at init,
  and under the player's own `@Observable` churn it compounds into a runaway
  allocation + re-render storm (see §9). Build the model **once**, off the render
  path: in the event handler that triggers presentation, or in a tiny wrapper
  view that creates it in `.task` gated by view identity. The Instances row (§2)
  is how you catch a regression of this — `AVPlayer` ≫ `Players` and climbing.

## 6. Case study: the navigation-churn freeze (June 2026)

**Symptom.** After scrolling a library and rapidly opening/closing a few
movies/shows, the app froze for many seconds, artwork stopped loading, and it
sometimes crashed. "It's an artwork/scroll bug."

**What the tools said.**
- Watchdog vitals during the freeze: memory climbed **96 MB → 1710 MB** while CPU
  sat at **~300%** (3 cores maxed) for ~40 s, then collapsed. Thread count stayed
  modest. So: a CPU + allocation **storm**, not a network stall, not a main hang.
- Time Profiler, aggregated **by thread**: the #2 CPU consumer was
  **`Heap Helper Thread` (~43 s of CPU)** — that is **JavaScriptCore's garbage
  collector** — alongside `JavaScriptCore libpas scavenger` and `JSC Heap Collector
  Thread`. Aggregated **by leaf binary**: a huge `UNKNOWN` (JIT) bucket plus
  `JavaScriptCore`. JavaScriptCore is pulled in by exactly one dependency:
  **YouTubeKit** (trailer extraction).

**Root cause.** Opening a detail page speculatively verified its trailer button by
running `YouTubeTrailerProvider.firstPlayableVideoID`, which extracted **every**
candidate video id **concurrently**; each `YouTube(videoID:).streams` spins a
JSContext that runs YouTube's large obfuscated player JS. The `StreamCache` task was
**detached from caller cancellation**, so navigating away never stopped in-flight
JS. Tap-through of several titles × several ids stacked dozens of JSContexts → the
JS heap ballooned to ~1.7 GB → the GC pinned three cores → freeze, then
memory-pressure jetsam. The "no artwork" was collateral: every core was doing GC.

**Fix (commit `7c06ee0`).**
- `ConcurrencyLimiter` gained a throwing `run` overload.
- `YouTubeTrailerProvider.extractionGate = ConcurrencyLimiter(limit: 1)` — *all*
  YouTubeKit extraction funnels through it, so at most one JSContext heap is ever
  live. Memory went **flat** and the GC stopped thrashing.
- `ItemDetailViewModel` gained an umbrella **0.8 s dwell** before any enrichment
  fan-out and a further **1.7 s dwell** before trailer JS — both cancelled on
  navigate-away. Fast browsing now starts **zero** speculative search/extraction;
  only a page settled on for ~2.5 s pays for it. The optimistic trailer button (from
  the server's own id) still appears instantly, so nothing the user sees is delayed.

**Confirmed by the tools.** Peak memory **1710 MB → 464 MB** (steady ~137 MB),
`MAIN BLOCKED` events **many → ~1**, CPU **~300% pinned → ~110% steady**.

**Lesson.** The label on the bug ("artwork", "scroll") pointed at the wrong
subsystem. Thread-level CPU aggregation named the real culprit (JSC GC) in one step,
and the fix was about *when/how much* speculative work runs, not about artwork at
all.

---

## 7. SwiftUI re-render storms (the second big class)

The storm in §6 was about *resources* (memory/CPU across cores). The other
recurring class is **the main thread doing too much SwiftUI work** — the app feels
laggy/janky during navigation or playback even though memory is flat and no single
binary dominates. The cause is almost always **a view body that re-evaluates far
more often, or far more widely, than it needs to.**

### How to recognise it in a Time Profiler trace

Attach to the live app (`--attach Plozz`) while reproducing, export the
`time-profile` table, then aggregate **by symbol** (Debug builds are
symbolicated, so this works):

```bash
# rank every frame's symbol across all samples
grep -oE '<frame [^>]*name="[^"]*"' /tmp/samples.xml \
  | sed -E 's/.*name="([^"]*)".*/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -40
```

It's a re-render storm (not a resource storm) when the top of that list is
SwiftUI machinery rather than your logic or a decoder:

- `specialized ... closure ... in Attribute.init<A>(_:)` — the attribute graph
  rebuilding nodes (a very common #1).
- `AG::Graph::UpdateStack::update()`, `AG::Subgraph::update`,
  `AG::Graph::propagate_dirty`, `AGGraphGetValue/SetOutputValue` — graph churn.
- `SDFLayer.updateSDFEffects`, `GlassContainer.*.shapeBounds`,
  `GlassEffectAnimatedPathSet.updateValue` — **Liquid Glass** recomputing its
  signed-distance-field per element (it does this whenever a glass view is laid
  out / focus-scaled).
- One of your own views as the top *app* symbol: `SomeView.body.getter`.

Three aggregations turn the raw samples into a diagnosis (≈20-line Python each;
all parse the same exported XML — resolve `<thread id=.. fmt=..>`/`<thread ref=..>`
to a name, the first `<frame>` is the innermost):

1. **Main vs background split.** A re-render storm is overwhelmingly on
   `Main Thread`. If 85–95 % of samples are main-thread, that's the smoking gun.
2. **Per-time-bin distribution** (bucket sample-times into 5 s bins). A steady
   non-zero floor when you *aren't* interacting means something animates/ticks
   continuously (a `TimelineView`, a 4×/sec clock); spikes only during focus
   moves mean it's focus-driven recompute.
3. **Render-path bucketing** — count samples whose stack matches `AG::Graph|
   Attribute.init` (swiftui-graph), `SDFLayer|GlassContainer|GlassEffect`
   (liquid-glass), `ShadowEffect|_shadow` (shadow), `resample|_decodeImage|
   rawPalette` (artwork decode), `commit_transaction|_copyRenderLayer`
   (CA-commit). This tells you *which* cost to attack and, just as importantly,
   **rules out** suspects (e.g. animated card shadows measured at 0.0 % here, so
   don't waste time "optimising" them).

Always also export `potential-hangs` (threshold 250 ms). Zero hangs + high main
utilisation = "death by a thousand re-renders", not one big stall.

### The fix patterns (in priority order)

1. **Scope an `@Observable` dependency to the smallest view that needs it.**
   With the Observation framework, SwiftUI tracks property reads **per view
   body**. If `BigView.body` reads a property that changes often
   (`controller.currentTime` ticks 4×/sec), the **entire** `BigView` re-evaluates
   on every change — rebuilding everything downstream (artwork, buttons, their
   `.glassEffect()` SDFs, backgrounds), none of which care about that property.
   **Fix:** move the hot read into a tiny dedicated child view so only it
   re-renders. A zero-size "sink" view that reads the value and forwards it into
   an `@Observable`/`@State` model is a clean way to confine a high-frequency
   clock (see `PlaybackClock` in `NowPlayingView.swift`).
   Continue Watching follows the same boundary: `ContinueWatchingSeriesLogo`
   owns its asynchronous logo and backdrop tones inside the overlay. Resolving
   contrast must not reconfigure the enclosing native poster; the hosted
   regression checks that boundary while preserving the overlay's geometry.
   Navigation selection bindings also keep their destination plan outside the
   getter: every rail item can read that getter several times during focus
   updates. Build the plan while constructing the binding, so SwiftUI observes
   library/layout changes there, but continue reading the live stored selection
   and entry override inside the getter.
2. **Make off-screen content lazy so Liquid Glass doesn't stay live.** A
   `.glassEffect()`/`plozzGlassCard` keeps recomputing its SDF as long as the
   view exists. Eager `HStack`/`VStack` rails inside a `ScrollView` keep *every*
   card (even off-screen) mounted and live. Use `LazyHStack`/`LazyVStack`/
   `LazyVGrid` so only visible cards pay. (This was the home nav-lag fix; the
   rest of the app already used lazy stacks.) Do **not** reach for
   `GlassEffectContainer` to "fix" it — Home/Search prove it's unnecessary and it
   can alter glass blending.
   The custom rail also defers Live TV's content factory until its first visit.
   Merely hiding it with opacity left its library-runtime refresh tasks and guide
   construction active during cold Home startup. `RetainedLiveTVDestination`
   mounts immediately when selected, keeps the same state after leaving, and
   resets with the profile identity. Hosted checks cover zero construction before
   visiting, initial standalone entry, retained state, and profile replacement.
3. **Throttle continuous animators.** A `TimelineView(.animation(minimumInterval:
   …))` re-renders its subtree at that rate forever while visible. Keep the
   interval as coarse as the effect allows and the animated subtree tiny (the
   now-playing equaliser is 4 capsules at 12.5 Hz → measured ~0.5 %, fine; a
   larger subtree at that rate would not be).
4. **Mind the `GeometryReader` + `.transition` gotcha.** Children of a
   `GeometryReader` do **not** inherit a `.move` transition — they snap to their
   final position while siblings slide. To animate such a subtree as one unit,
   keep it mounted and animate `.offset`/`.opacity` instead of insert/remove.
5. **Keep scheduling-only activity out of render state.** Home's remote-move
   handler previously wrote a `@State` timestamp used only by the share-refresh
   idle gate. A physical-TV SwiftUI causes trace linked five Home invalidations
   directly to `HomeView.lastInteractionAt.setter`; each propagated through
   `ContentStateView`, the hero, and row construction during navigation.
   `HomeNavigationActivity` now keeps that timestamp in a non-observable,
   Home-owned reference. The ancestor still records every move and delays
   watchlist refreshes; the share observer reads the latest timestamp when
   checking its unchanged 30-second idle grace. Do not make this clock
   observable or copy its timestamp back into a view's `@State`.
6. **Debouncing does not move CPU work off MainActor.** A later Home hang report
   identified `scheduleReenrich` calling the synchronous `reenrich` merge on the
   main thread. Its identity traversal repeatedly reached title normalization,
   blocking navigation for seconds even after the activity-clock fix.
   Reenrichment now merges an immutable content copy on a utility worker and
   publishes on MainActor only if its content revision is still current.
   Concurrent reloads or watch mutations force a fresh fold; a superseding pass
   or cancellation cannot publish stale results or call the old completion.
   Keep that protection when changing the worker boundary, and retain the
   order-stable merge rather than re-sorting Continue Watching.
7. **Ask only for the action a visible control needs.** The Home hero previously
   built the complete context-menu catalog just to draw its bookmark button,
   repeating provider-ownership identity lookups on focus changes. Its
   `watchlistAction` query now shares the catalog's eligibility rules but skips
   unrelated identity, provider-capability and download work when Plozz owns the
   watchlist. Membership still uses the live revision-aware cache; legacy
   provider watchlists and custom handlers retain their full-menu fallback.
   The UIKit foreground also retains its ratings hosting view and updates its
   isolated ratings state only when scores change. Focus, selection and paging
   gauge updates must not replace that SwiftUI root with unchanged badges.

### Profiling that ends in "no change" is a valid, valuable result

Sometimes the measurement exonerates the code: the decode pipeline is already
off-main, shadows are free, the hot path is intrinsic Liquid Glass that the lazy
fix already minimised, and there's no rogue loop left. **Reporting "measured, it's
clean, here's the breakdown" is a real outcome** — it stops you from cargo-culting
"optimisations" that cost readability and fix nothing. Record the numbers so the
next agent doesn't re-chase a ghost.

### Home backdrop composition and comparison controls

Home's ambient tint and hero-logo contrast consume the bitmap adopted by the
visible renderer, not another pass through the candidate artwork URLs. This
includes first-paint online choices, library fallbacks, preview/full upgrades,
and cached returns. Detail pages own separate display state; incoming carousel
slides, reflections, and inactive/outgoing owners cannot replace the current
sample. Deferred reports coalesce per owner and item, so a late report from the
previous item cannot discard the current item's pending image. Reports may
precede source activation; releasing an owner cancels all of its pending items.
Derived colors remain bounded/cached, and palette extraction stays
off-main with the existing navigation coalescing. Disabling gradients does not
disable the shared logo-contrast sample.

Plex photo requests fit inside both variant dimensions (`minSize=0`,
`upscale=0`). Clamping width alone with a portrait-shaped minimum-size request
can otherwise transfer a 5333x3000 landscape response for a 2000px hero.

For a Home/Showcase background-color mismatch, enable the existing
`PLZHEROART=1` trace for a bounded reproduction and filter `plzheroart.log` for
`palette`. `hero` events identify the image actually fronted (including preview
upgrades), `sample` events identify the image used for color extraction, `ambient`
events distinguish cached/applied palettes from stock fallback, and `mesh`
events record the actual input and theme-adjusted output RGB components.
Correlate item/reference fingerprints, the ambient cache key, and timestamps;
compare full-resolution pixel fingerprints rather than preview/full pairs.
Image fingerprints use a tiny off-main sample, and references are hashed without
exposing authenticated URLs. No diagnostic changes the artwork or colors.
Record the settled screen and input sequence before copying
`Library/Caches/plzheroart.log` from the app container. End the reproduction with
`PLZHEROART=0` on the next launch to clear its persistent tracing latch.

tvOS uses cached shading by default where it preserves the original treatment.
iOS retains analytic shading by default. These launch overrides do not change saved settings:

| Launch flag | Rendering change |
| --- | --- |
| `PLZHOME_CACHED_SCRIM=0` | Forces the original analytic shading for a control recording. |
| `PLZHOME_CACHED_SCRIM=1` | Uses the pre-rendered alpha texture where eligible (also opt-in on iOS). |

Compare cached shading against the analytic reference with the same artwork,
theme, row population, and input cadence. The shading selection never
changes the page scroll, recede distances, or 0.9/0.96-second animation choices.
Local layer-count and screenshot improvements are not proof of Apple TV frame
rate; confirm on the physical device before promoting an experiment.

`HeroLegibilityTexture` uses native-size 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 alpha assets,
not a runtime `drawingGroup`. The texture is tinted for opaque black/white in
left-to-right layouts; other tones and right-to-left layouts retain the analytic
`HeroLegibilityScrim` path. The RTL fallback preserves the platform's own leading
edge behavior, which differed between the tvOS 26 and 27 comparisons. Its fixed parameters
match Home's current leading/bottom treatment. Regenerate with
`python3 tools/generate_home_scrim.py` whenever those parameters change, and
verify with `python3 tools/generate_home_scrim.py --check` plus
`python3 tools/test_generate_home_scrim.py`.

Pinned Home navigation selects a second baked texture with the same wash, leading
strength/width, and bottom curve, extending the leading fade to the full height.
It replaces the standard texture rather than adding an overlay, blur, shadow,
or runtime rasterization. Home reads `plozzPinnedSidebarActive`, not the changing
content inset. Detail pages have no sidebar and use the original softer upper-left
corner for every navigation style. The analytic comparison and RTL/custom-tone
fallback use the same respective treatment. Native Home navigation and mobile keep the
original texture/parameters. The lower field (from 62% height) and the artwork
beyond the leading fade (42% width) are unchanged. Compact rail glyphs no longer
carry individual shadows; the expanded menu keeps its existing glass backing.

During a cinematic detail entrance, scrim opacity begins its existing 0.45-second
reveal when the artwork cover hands off, before the logo's 0.10-second pause ends.
It stays anchored inside the existing bottom dissolve; it does not use the
foreground's translation or add another mask. Late artwork/video readiness still
gates the sequence. Disabled transitions, Reduce Motion, and missing artwork
show the completed shading without a separate entrance delay.

An opaque color-fade experiment did not replace the original alpha mask: it
introduced a visible seam and differed during intermediate animation frames.
Adding rectangular clipping fixed a synthetic overdraw fixture but not the
reported device seam. The experiment and its runtime switches were removed
before landing; the accepted renderer retains the original mask.

#### Measure presentation separately from callbacks and startup

`PlozzHomeRemoteTests` can drive a bounded, repeatable Down/Up sequence against
the installed app without changing its saved settings. It requires the explicit
runner opt-in `PLOZZ_HOME_REMOTE_CAPTURE=1` and checks the actual Home hero focus
target, not merely whether the app is foreground. Reject profile-picker runs.

For native animation metrics, launch the app with `PLZPERF_ANIMATIONS=1` and set
`PLOZZ_HOME_ANIMATION_METRICS=1` on the runner. `HomeRecede` and `HomeReturn`
animation signposts cover separate 1.2-second windows around the unchanged
0.9/0.96-second movements. Read XCTest's **hitch time ratio**, not just the
display-link FPS counter. On an Apple TV 4K (2nd generation), a same-build,
12-sample comparison starting the driver 120 seconds after each launch request measured
mean Down/Up hitch ratios of 159.9/285.9 ms/s with analytic shading versus
0.0/10.2 ms/s with cached shading, both using the original alpha dissolve.
Callback counters alone had obscured this difference. The frame-count metric
returned zero on this toolchain; do not report it as a valid frame count.

Those results do **not** establish startup performance. Keep early-launch and
later-navigation measurements separate, record actual first-move timestamps and
background curation activity, and reverse comparison order. Do not wait for
background loading to finish in a test intended to cover startup. XCTest's
quiescence waits can delay input even with no explicit settling delay; verify
the actual navigation markers. An experimental prestarted-driver handshake did
not prove early input and was removed. This toolchain also returned no native metrics when the app process
changed after the test session started. Empty metrics are an invalid capture,
not zero hitches or a successful performance result.

A subsequent manually driven startup pair did overlap background curation:
first Down was at 10.9/10.4 seconds, before curation completed at 17.9/16.8
seconds (original/cached, relative to Home's first diagnostic event, not process
start). The first 20-second callback windows were similar: median smoothed FPS
59 in both, reported hitches 2.66/2.55 per second. This establishes loading
overlap, **not** a proven startup improvement or presented-frame equivalence.
Keep that limitation separate from the native animation results above.

#### Investigating a visible position jump

A temporary, passive geometry recorder sampled the hero's UIKit coordinates,
page scroll offset, content height and inset without steering focus. Its file
logger and runtime switch were removed before landing. Retain recordings as
investigation artifacts, not as production instrumentation.

A tvOS 27 capture found 40–60-point hero steps following delayed updates while
hero heights and the top inset stayed constant. A separate Time Profiler capture
showed main-thread SwiftUI/AttributeGraph work and substantial background share
scanning. Do not call every large coordinate step a layout-size change, or blame
all of it on GPU composition.

One measured source of redundant focus-time work was eager context-menu action
preparation. A deferred-content experiment eliminated unopened-menu queries in
a hosted test and opened the real menu, but its same-binary comparison did not
establish a fix for the remaining jumps. Native dismissal/focus verification
also remained inconclusive. That experiment was removed rather than mixing it
into subsequent motion comparisons.

An isolated-transaction experiment explicitly interpolated the offset before
clearing child animations; clearing the transaction around an ordinary offset
made UIKit content snap in the hosted comparison. It keeps the original native
gradient mask, because rebuilding that gradient from an interpolated start
position differed during the fade. The shared movement modifier retained for
production instead uses the original inherited animation transaction; hosted
tests compare its rendered positions, UIKit geometry and reversal.

Do not attribute improvements in an isolation-OFF control to that experimental
path. One tvOS 27 control reported zero hitches in all twelve measured Down
windows and all twelve Up windows, and was the run the viewer reported as
smoother. This does not establish the cause of the improvement, nor prove that
busy-startup cases are fixed.

A repeat with a focus assertion after every Down and Up still recorded occasional
hitches: mean Down/Up ratios of 5.8/1.1 ms/s in the control. Isolation ON measured
9.3/0.0 ms/s and more large sampled coordinate steps in that comparison, so it
was not accepted as an overall improvement. The isolated path was removed before
landing. Keep the successful cached-shading change separate from that experiment.

#### TV show detail backdrops

`HeroBackdropLayer` uses the same `HeroLegibilityTexture` and generated alpha
asset as Home on tvOS. Its fixed wash, leading/bottom edges, peak and side ramp
are identical. Only those static layers are cached: detail's own linear bottom
dissolve, series hero masks, recede/return animation, episode rail and trailer
handoff remain unchanged. RTL and custom tones retain native shading; iOS keeps
its existing default.

Use `PLZDETAIL_CACHED_SCRIM=0` for an analytic control. The layer also accepts
`prefersCachedScrim` for embedding and visual comparisons. Hosted coverage
compares the complete backdrop across themes, directions, full/short heights
and vertical offsets, including clipping of a video-like UIKit layer.

Long-show checks should use a real large episode collection, such as the
animated One Piece series. `SeriesHeroCaptureTests` verifies hero/browser focus
round trips when explicitly enabled with `PLOZZ_DETAIL_REMOTE_CAPTURE=1`.
That is functional coverage, not a performance claim: empty native timing
results and disconnected Instruments captures must not be counted as zero
hitches. Episode-count-dependent work may require separate CPU investigation.

## 8. Case study: the "whole app is laggy" player re-render (June 2026)

**Symptom.** Two reports: (a) the full-screen music player felt heavy, and (b)
home-screen focus felt laggy when sweeping left↔right across Recently Played /
Albums / Artists. "Everything is laggy" — sounds global.

**What the tools said.**
- Attached Time Profiler to the *live* app (`--attach Plozz`) during each repro.
  No hangs ≥250 ms in either; memory flat. So: re-render storm, not a resource
  storm.
- **Player trace:** ~11 k samples in 30 s, ~3× the player's earlier baseline. Top
  app symbol `NowPlayingView.body.getter`, with the whole player subtree
  (artwork, meta, transport buttons, equaliser, lyrics) and a lot of
  `Attribute.init`/`AnimatorState`/`FluidSpringAnimation` underneath. The body
  read `controller.currentTime` (which ticks **4×/sec**, `CMTime(timescale: 4)`)
  in three places, so the *entire* player re-evaluated four times a second.
- **Home trace:** ~17 k samples in 60 s, **90 % on the main thread**. Render-path
  bucketing: swiftui-graph 3.5 %, **liquid-glass SDF 3.4 %**, CA-commit 0.5 %,
  blit/mask 0.4 %, **animated shadows 0.0 % (ruled out)**. Artwork
  decode/resample/palette was **100 % off-main** (healthy). The now-playing pill
  did **not** read `currentTime` (no 4×/sec pill re-render). The equaliser's
  12.5 Hz `TimelineView` was only ~0.5 %.

**Root cause & fix.**
- *Player:* `NowPlayingView.body` depended on the 4×/sec clock. Moved the
  `currentTime` reads into two tiny child views — `LyricsPanel` (the lyrics column
  legitimately needs the position to highlight/scroll, so only it re-renders) and
  `PlaybackClock` (a zero-size sink that forwards `currentTime`/`duration` into
  the scrub model). The rest of the player stopped re-rendering during playback.
  (commit `be020b3`.)
- *Home:* the dominant cost was Liquid Glass SDF recompute on focus. The big
  multiplier — **eager** music-landing rails keeping every off-screen card's glass
  live — was converted to `LazyHStack` (matching the rest of the app), which
  removed the off-screen glass cost with zero visual change. (commit `6d008de`.)
  After that, the remaining glass cost is intrinsic per-focused-card recompute;
  a 60 s re-profile found no rogue hot spot left — a legitimate "it's clean now"
  result.

**Lesson.** "Everything is laggy" was two *different*, local re-render problems,
not one global one. Symbol-level aggregation (not just thread/binary) named both
in one step each: a single high-frequency property read fanning out across a big
body, and eager containers keeping Liquid Glass alive off-screen. The fixes were
about **scoping dependencies and laziness**, and the render-path bucketing was as
useful for *ruling out* the wrong suspect (shadows) as for finding the right one.

## 9. Case study: the "playback degrades the longer the app is open" engine storm (June 2026)

> **Historical note:** this incident predates the mpv-engine retirement, so the
> overlay readings quoted below include an `mpv <z>` column and `MPVVideoEngine`
> symbols that no longer exist. The mechanism and lesson are unchanged; today the
> Instances row reads `Players <x> · AVPlayer <y>` and the on-device engine is
> Plozzigen.

**Symptom.** Playback silky-smooth right after a fresh launch, then "slower and
slower the longer the app is open" and the more you play/browse; a full
quit+reopen resets it to smooth. Felt global. The leading hypothesis was a repeat
of the §6 JavaScriptCore storm (same "accumulates over time, restart fixes it"
signature).

**It was not the leading hypothesis.** The §6 fix (commit `7c06ee0`) was verified
fully intact on the branch — `extractionGate` caps JSContexts at 1, dwell gates
present and cancellable, no other uncapped JSContext caller. So: measure, don't
assume. The hunt then pivoted twice on live overlay readings before any code
changed.

**What the tools said.**
- **Instances row (§2)** during repro: `Players` and `AVPlayer` climbed as
  playback was retried, and crucially **`AVPlayer` raced far ahead of `Players`**
  (e.g. `Players 22 · AVPlayer 165 · mpv 25`) with **Thermal → Serious** and memory
  ~855 MB. It also **"climbed, corrected down to 2–5, then climbed again"** — so
  the instances were *reachable throwaways*, not a permanent leak (which would be
  monotonic). That ruled the bug *in* as object-churn from over-construction and
  ruled *out* both a retain cycle and the JSC storm.
- **Time Profiler, attached to the live lag:** ~36.7 k samples in 50 s (vs ~163
  when the same app was idle/frozen earlier — i.e. a real compute storm, not a
  stall). Aggregating Debug symbols: the main thread was pinned in an
  **AttributeGraph render loop** (`ViewGraphRootValueUpdater.render`,
  `AG::Graph::UpdateStack::update`, `GraphHost.flushTransactions`,
  `CA::Transaction::commit` every DisplayLink tick). The hot **app** symbols were
  `PlayerViewModel.startPlayback` → `NativeVideoEngine.load`/`MPVVideoEngine.load`
  → `handleEngineFailure` → `playResolved`, plus many `mpv_create`,
  `AVPlayer.init`, and **`makePlayerViewModel`** — construction on the hot path.

**Root cause.** `makePlayerViewModel(...)` was called **inside** the
`.fullScreenCover(item:)` content closure for both the Home and Search tabs.
SwiftUI re-invokes a cover's content closure on every parent render; `PlayerView`
keeps its model in `@State` (first value wins), so every extra render **built a
full `PlayerViewModel` — and a `NativeVideoEngine` at its `init` — and discarded
it**. Once playback was underway the player's own `@Observable` mutations *drove*
those renders, so the throwaways compounded: a self-reinforcing storm of engine
allocation feeding AttributeGraph churn feeding more renders. `AVPlayer` led
`Players` because every model builds a native engine *before* routing decides to
use mpv. Nothing was leaked — the instances were reachable and drained in bursts
— which is exactly why a restart "fixed" it and why the counts oscillated instead
of pinning.

**Fix (commit `6d6503a`).** Hoisted construction off the render path into a small
`PlayerPresentation` wrapper that builds the model **exactly once in `.task`**,
gated by the view's identity; both `.fullScreenCover` sites now pass a `make:`
factory closure that is only invoked inside `.task`, never during a render.

**Confirmed by the tools.** After the fix the Instances row sits at
~`Players 1 · AVPlayer 1` during playback instead of racing into the
dozens/hundreds; thermal and lag stay flat the longer the player is up.
Device-confirmed by Brandon.

**Lesson.** "Degrades over time + restart fixes it" does **not** imply the §6 JSC
storm — confirm the suspected cause is even live before chasing it. The decisive
signal here was the **Instances row**, not a trace: climbing counts that
*correct down* mean over-**construction** (reachable throwaways), and
`AVPlayer ≫ Players`
pointed straight at view-model construction. The fix was a one-view structural
change (build the model once, off the render path), echoing §8's theme — most
"playback/whole-app is slow" bugs are SwiftUI doing work it shouldn't, in the
wrong place or too often.

## 10. Case study: the player view-model retain cycle (July 2026, iOS)

**Symptom.** `Players` climbed by one per player presentation and never fell —
9 after a few opens. `AVPlayer` stayed at 0 (Plozzigen was driving playback), so
the engines *were* being released; only the view-models survived. tvOS was
unaffected.

**How it was found (and how long it wasted).** Roughly two hours went into
reading code first: every collaborator's `weak var host`, all seven engine
callbacks, notification observers, display links, the diagnostics sampler, every
`Task` capture — all correct. Then four rounds of on-device bisecting that
stripped the player's views one at a time (no `PlayerView`, no controls overlay,
no observed property reads, no `onChange`) — it still leaked, which proved no
view was responsible but did not say what was.

**The Memory Graph Debugger named it in one screenshot:**

```
PlayerViewModel → _onSubtitleStyleChanged.context
                → SwiftUI.StoredLocation<PlayerViewModel>
                → PlayerViewModel
```

**Root cause — a bug class worth memorising.** A closure stored ON a model that
reads a property of the **view struct** captures `self`. If that view holds the
model in `@State`, the model owns a closure that owns the view that owns the
model. Nothing is declared wrong, so no amount of auditing `weak` finds it.

```swift
// LEAKS: `appModel` is a view property, so this captures the whole view struct,
// including its @State box holding `viewModel`.
viewModel.onSubtitleStyleChanged = { appModel.settings.subtitleStyle.style = $0 }

// CORRECT: hoist what the closure needs, so it captures only that.
let settings = appModel.settings
viewModel.onSubtitleStyleChanged = { settings.subtitleStyle.style = $0 }
```

tvOS was immune because `PlayerPresentation` receives that callback as a
parameter from `MainTabViewSupport` rather than building it from its own state.
**"Does the other platform leak?" is a high-value early question** — a clean
platform means the shared code is fine and the shell is at fault.

### The procedure (2 minutes)

1. Xcode → select the **`PlozziOS`** scheme for iPhone/iPad (NOT `Plozz`, which
   is tvOS — the device shows "mismatched platform" if you forget) → Run.
2. Reproduce: open and close the player 2–3 times.
3. Debug bar → **Memory Graph** icon (three connected nodes).
4. Filter the left panel for the leaked type (e.g. `PlayerViewModel`).
5. Select a leaked instance: the graph draws every object still pointing at it,
   **with the owning property named on each edge**. That label is the bug.

### Supporting instrumentation (in the tree)

`PlayerViewModel` emits `vm LIFECYCLE init/deinit id=… live=N` through
`HandoffDiagnostics`. Matching ids prove whether `deinit` ever runs — the counter
alone doesn't say which instance survived. Pull the journal off-device without
Xcode (it survives relaunch):

```bash
xcrun devicectl device copy from --device <UDID> \
  --domain-type appDataContainer --domain-identifier com.thatcube.Plozz \
  --source Library/Caches/Plozz/playback-trace.log --destination /tmp/trace.log
grep "vm LIFECYCLE" /tmp/trace.log     # healthy: every init has a deinit, ends live=0
```

`CFGetRetainCount(self)` at teardown tells you HOW MANY owners remain (one
stubborn owner vs a race) but never WHO. Only the memory graph answers who.

## 11. Case study: share-scan progress + media-state feedback loop (August 2026, iOS)

**Symptom.** During a media-share update, the Settings progress bar and counts
repeatedly faded/flashed. After the directory walk appeared finished, an iPhone
16 Pro Max remained warm and the whole app felt expensive.

**Measurement.** A 30-second attached Debug Time Profiler trace recorded about
27 CPU-seconds (roughly 90% of one core), including 5.9 seconds on Main Thread.
Inclusive stack buckets were 27.7% SwiftUI graph work, 27.6% share scan/catalog
work, and 14.7% watchlist/alias work. There were no hangs over 250 ms.

**Two independent causes were active.**

1. `ShareScanStatusModel` accepted every per-item enrichment update through an
   unbounded stream and replaced its observable state dictionary for every event.
   Scheduler pauses also emitted a false enrichment finish; resume emitted another
   start, repeatedly removing and reinserting the progress presentation.
2. The shell observed alias/watchlist snapshots and responded to every mutation by
   preparing the watchlist again. Preparation fetched native provider watchlists,
   enriched aliases, and republished the observed snapshot, forming a feedback
   cycle. Idempotent alias activation also assigned an unchanged snapshot.

**Fix pattern.**

- Coalesce high-frequency progress before it reaches `@Observable` state. Keep only
  the latest scan and enrichment value per share, publish at most every 250 ms,
  flush before lifecycle completion, and fence late progress.
- A scheduler pause is not logical completion. Keep one start/finish pair for the
  whole durable backlog.
- Keep progress view identity stable; update width/opacity rather than conditionally
  replacing determinate/indeterminate bars and percentage nodes.
- Separate profile-selection observation (which may hydrate/import) from snapshot
  observation (which may only schedule debounced cloud capture).
- Deduplicate unchanged snapshots and batch an identity-index evidence wave into
  one durable write/publication.

**Regression proof.** The focused tests drive 10,000 progress events and require
one observable progress publication, require no publication after finish, require
one enrichment lifecycle across pause/resume, and require a 1,000-alias evidence
wave to persist once while an identical repeat persists zero times.

**Follow-up device evidence.** A 60-second trace of the corrected build recorded
9.3 CPU-seconds total versus 27 CPU-seconds in the original 30-second trace. The
first ten seconds contained bounded scan/catalog completion; after that, idle
bins held near 0.1 CPU-seconds per five seconds (about 2% of one core), with
nominal thermal state and no UI hangs. A separate 180-second fresh-launch trace
showed one bounded scan burst, then returned to 1.6-3.7% of one core with nominal
thermals. Its three 254-299 ms microhang intervals aligned with attach/scene
transitions rather than steady foreground UI.

That longer trace exposed one remaining lifecycle gap: share catalog work kept
running after the app resigned active. Both shells now send revisioned scene
state into the shared runtime. Inactive apps cancel and checkpoint scans, pause
the durable metadata scheduler without polling, and retain explicit forced-rescan
intent. Returning active resumes the latest phase only; stale out-of-order scene
deliveries cannot leave work paused or restart it off-screen. Tests require no
scan restart while inactive, forced closure of cancellation-insensitive active
and draining scan transports, cancellation of a running metadata slice, durable
resume, force preservation, and latest-revision wins.
